Is
there
anything
else
you
need
,
honey
?
""
my
dad
asked
me
as
he
put
three
twenty
dollar
bills
in
my
hand
.
I
was
traveling
back
home
from
a
family
visit
,
and
after
treating
me
to
breakfast
and
filling
my
car
with
gas
,
it
was
obvious
that
my
dad
wanted
to
make
sure
that
I
would
be
okay
on
the
road
.
 
""
No
,
Dad
.
You
've
done
so
much
already
.
Thank
you
!
""
I
was
overwhelmed
once
again
by
his
kind
acts
of
providing
everything
I
needed
,
although
I
turned
40
.
Yet
I
realize
that
in
my
father
's
eyes
,
I
will
always
be
his
little
girl
.
He
takes
deep
pleasure
in
knowing
his
children
are
all
right
.
Now
that
he
has
enough
money
,
he
loves
to
give
whenever
he
sees
a
need
.
 
But
this
was
not
always
the
case
.
Divorced
from
my
mother
when
I
was
11
,
my
dad
could
n't
be
around
his
kids
as
often
as
he
would
have
liked
.
Money
was
also
tight
;
even
weekend
visits
were
rare
.
However
,
my
dad
stayed
in
constant
communication
with
us
and
made
sure
he
was
involved
in
our
lives
.
Though
he
could
n't
always
be
there
in
person
,
I
knew
he
was
only
a
phone
call
away
.
I
could
always
make
sure
of
that
.
 
Even
now
,
almost
30
years
later
,
I
treasure
knowing
that
I
can
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
Dad
,
and
he
'll
be
there
for
me
.
I
have
a
wonderful
husband
,
but
that
has
n't
changed
how
Dad
sees
me
.
I
'm
still
his
child
and
he
loves
to
see
that
my
needs
are
met
.
 
I
remember
a
time
when
I
was
shopping
in
a
hardware
store
with
Dad
.
I
mentioned
my
plans
to
paint
one
wall
in
my
house
.
Well
,
that
's
all
it
took
for
Dad
to
take
action
.
By
the
time
I
got
to
the
checkout
line
,
all
the
supplies
I
picked
out
were
put
out
of
my
hands
and
placed
with
things
he
bought
.
 
Then
there
was
the
time
when
I
took
him
with
me
to
do
some
grocery
shopping
for
just
a
few
""
items
""
.
By
the
time
we
were
finished
,
my
shopping
cart
was
full
of
groceries
from
every
shelf
in
the
store
!
My
sister
and
I
joke
that
if
you
do
n't
want
Dad
to
buy
it
for
you
,
avoid
even
mentioning
you
want
something

"At
the
moment
,
it
may
be
difficult
to
imagine
,
but
many
people
believe
that
,
by
the
year
2100
,
we
will
live
on
the
planet
Mars
.
Our
own
planet
,
Earth
,
is
becoming
more
and
more
crowed
and
polluted
.
Luckily
,
we
can
start
again
and
build
a
better
world
on
Mars
.
Here
is
what
life
could
be
like
.
 
First
of
all
,
transport
should
be
much
better
.
At
present
,
our
spaceships
are
too
slow
to
carry
large
numbers
of
people
to
Mars
--
it
takes
months
.
However
,
by
2100
,
spaceship
can
travel
at
half
the
speed
of
light
.
It
might
take
us
two
or
three
days
to
get
to
Mars
!
 
Secondly
,
humans
need
food
,
water
and
air
to
live
.
Scientists
should
be
able
to
develop
plants
that
can
be
grown
on
Mars
.
These
plants
will
produce
the
food
and
air
that
we
need
.
However
,
can
these
plants
produce
water
for
us
?
There
is
no
answer
now
.
 
There
is
a
problem
for
us
to
live
on
Mars
.
Mars
pulls
us
much
less
than
the
Earth
does
.
This
will
be
dangerous
because
we
could
easily
jump
too
high
and
fly
slowly
away
into
space
.
To
prevent
this
,
humans
on
Mars
have
to
wear
special
shoes
to
make
themselves
heavier
.
 
Life
on
Mars
will
be
better
than
that
on
Earth
in
many
ways
,
People
will
have
more
space
.
Living
in
a
large
building
with
only
10
bedrooms
is
highly
possible
.
Many
people
believe
that
robot
will
do
most
of
our
work
,
so
we
have
more
time
for
our
hobbies
.
 
There
will
probably
be
no
school
on
Mars
.
Every
student
will
have
a
computer
at
home
which
is
connected
to
the
internet
.
They
can
study
,
do
their
homework
and
take
exams
in
online
schools
.
Each
student
will
also
have
their
own
online
teacher
called
""
e-teacher
""
.
 
However
,
in
some
ways
,
life
on
Mars
may
not
be
better
than
that
on
the
earth
today
.
Food
will
not
be
the
same
--
meals
will
probably
be
in
the
form
of
pills
and
will
not
be
as
delicious
as
they
are
today
,
Also
,
space
travel
will
make
many
people
feel
ill
.
The
spaceship
will
travel
fast
but
the
journey
to
Mars
will
probably
be
very
uncomfortable

"Do
you
want
to
be
a
successful
person
?
Would
you
like
to
know
how
successful
people
usually
think
and
what
drives
them
?
Here
I
am
going
to
tell
you
the
key
to
success
that
successful
people
share
.
 
First
of
all
,
successful
people
never
blame
someone
or
something
outside
of
themselves
for
their
failure
to
move
ahead
.
They
realize
that
their
future
lies
in
their
own
hands
.
They
understand
that
they
ca
n't
control
things
in
life
,
such
as
nature
,
the
past
and
other
people
.
At
the
same
time
,
they
are
well
aware
that
they
can
control
their
own
thoughts
and
actions
.
They
take
responsibility
for
their
life
.
 
Perhaps
what
most
separates
successful
people
from
others
is
that
they
live
life
""
on
purpose
""
--
-
they
are
doing
what
they
believe
they
are
put
here
to
do
.
In
their
opinion
,
having
a
purpose
in
their
life
is
the
most
important
element
that
enables
them
to
deal
with
things
around
them
.
They
hold
the
view
that
when
they
live
their
life
""
on
purpose
""
,
their
main
concern
is
to
do
the
job
right
.
They
live
what
they
do
.
People
want
to
do
business
with
them
because
of
their
commitment
.
To
live
their
life
""
on
purpose
""
,
successful
people
find
a
cause
they
believe
in
and
create
a
business
around
it
.
 
Besides
,
they
never
give
up
easily
.
Once
they
have
set
up
goals
in
their
life
,
they
are
willing
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
achieve
their
goals
.
To
achievers
always
bear
in
mind
what
they
do
n't
have
forever
.
Rather
than
see
this
as
negative
or
depressing
,
they
would
use
the
knowledge
to
spur
themselves
on
and
go
after
what
they
want
energetically
and
passionately
.
 
So
keep
in
mind
what
successful
people
always
hold
to
be
true
so
that
you
will
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
you
should
do
to
be
successful
in
life

"Anyone
who
has
experienced
the
joy
of
driving
through
a
rainstorm
with
the
sunroof
open
understands
how
airflow
around
the
moving
vehicles
can
keep
him
dry
despite
the
exposure
.
Now
a
similar
principle
is
being
employed
to
create
an
umbrella
that
protects
people
from
the
rain
using
nothing
more
than
an
invisible
air
force
field
.
 
Air
Umbrella
,
developed
by
a
Chinese
company
and
recently
funded
by
Kickstarter
,
uses
forced
air
rather
than
fabric
to
create
a
protective
canopy
that
keeps
people
from
getting
wet
in
the
rain
.
 
It
's
a
clever
concept
and
designers
have
done
a
good
job
of
answering
several
questions
about
the
product
.
For
instance
,
the
sound
generated
by
the
device
is
minimal
,
especially
when
compared
to
the
pitter-patter
of
the
falling
rain
.
It
can
create
a
protective
canopy
wide
enough
for
two
people
to
fit
under
and
it
performs
well
even
in
the
heavy
rain
.
The
air
shield
can
be
cut
through
by
high
winds
,
but
given
that
regular
umbrellas
typically
fold
over
in
similar
windy
conditions
,
the
air
umbrella
is
still
an
upgrade
.
 
A
few
concerns
do
remain
,
however
.
For
instance
,
the
battery
life
is
only
about
15-30
minutes
depending
on
the
model
,
so
you
'll
still
want
to
walk
briskly
to
your
next
destination
when
it
's
raining
.
Also
,
while
the
air
shield
might
keep
the
rain
away
from
you
,
it
's
likely
to
splash
all
that
blown-away
water
onto
anyone
else
like
a
sprinkler
.
So
the
device
might
draw
the
ire
of
anyone
else
walking
with
you
,
or
any
helpless
bystanders
.
 
There
are
currently
three
different
types
to
choose
from
if
you
're
interested
in
investing
.
Air
Umbrella-A
is
the
lightest
model
,
and
is
apparently
designed
specifically
for
females
,
according
to
the
Chinese
developers
.
It
is
about
12
inches
in
length
and
weighs
a
little
over
a
pound
,
and
it
runs
for
15
minutes
per
charge
.
Air
Umbrella-B
measures
nearly
20
inches
long
and
weighs
1.7
pounds
,
and
lasts
30
minutes
per
charge
.
Finally
,
Air
Umbrella-C
also
lasts
30
minutes
,
but
is
scalable
between
20
and
32
inches
depending
on
your
needs

"WILD
WEATHERMAN
 
Name
:
Sam
Champion
 
Hot
job
:
TV
Weatherman
 
Where
:
ABC-TV
,
New
York
City
 
When
you
were
a
child
,
did
you
plan
to
forecast
wind
,
rain
,
and
snow
on
TV
?
 
I
wanted
to
be
a
foreign
journalist
.
I
took
courses
in
weather
science
at
Eastern
Kentucky
University
,
but
I
majored
in
broadcasting
news
.
 
How
did
you
finally
become
a
weatherman
?
 
My
first
job
in
the
early
1980s
was
at
the
local
TV
station
in
Paducah
,
Kentucky
.
I
did
everything
from
turning
on
the
lights
in
the
morning
to
writing
and
delivering
morning
news
.
I
put
together
weather
forecasts
,
and
became
interested
in
them
.
 
Back
then
,
how
did
you
forecast
weather
?
 
Independent
companies
collected
computer
information
that
showed
,
for
example
,
how
a
single
weather
system
might
split
into
snow
or
snow
mixed
with
rain
.
The
information
was
often
opposite
and
the
job
of
a
weatherman
was
to
study
the
information
and
make
the
best
educated
guess
about
the
storm
.
 
Has
weather
forecasting
changed
much
with
new
technology
?
 
Advanced
computers
,
satellites
,
and
Doppler
radar
(
sound
waves
used
to
track
storms
)
have
made
forecasting
more
exact
.
But
we
still
know
very
little
about
how
weather
is
shaped
.
So
far
,
we
just
have
theories
.
 
Any
advice
for
children
who
'd
like
to
become
weather
scientists
?
 
To
me
,
weather
is
the
most
exciting
field
in
the
world
.
There
are
still
so
many
more
questions
about
weather
than
answers
.
After
all
,
if
we
ca
n't
foresee
floods
or
hurricanes
,
how
safe
a
society
are
we
?
Weather
forecasting
is
wide
open
for
scientists
who
love
to
solve
puzzling
problems
.
The
next
generation
of
meteorologists
(
weather
scientists
)
will
unlock
many
of
Earth
's
weather
secrets
.
So
get
a
general
knowledge
of
Earth
science
,
and
study
meteorology
in
college
.
 
Thanks
,
Sam

"Ten
years
ago
,
Morgan
Zuch
,
a
two
--
year
--
old
girl
from
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
was
diagnosed
with
leukemia
.
The
day
that
Morgan
's
father
Rod
knew
it
,
he
made
a
promise
,
""
If
my
daughter
gets
better
,
I
will
devote
the
rest
of
my
life
to
helping
others
who
are
in
the
Same
condition
.
""
 
Fortunately
.
Morgan
recovered
gradually
,
and
since
then
,
Rod
and
his
wife
Nancy
,
have
been
helping
other
families
with
cancer.stricken
children
through
the
Morgan
Center
.
It
is
the
country
's
first
preschool
for
children
with
cancer
.
 
Because
of
the
risk
of
germs
,
children
with
cancer
are
usually
forbidden
from
playing
with
other
kids
.
They
must
spend
their
days
in
hospital
rooms
or
lying
in
bed
at
home
.
The
Zuchs
believed
that
children
with
cancer
should
have
the
opportunity
to
play
,
too
.
 
The
center
offers
the
kids
and
their
families
a
safe
place
to
connect
with
others
who
have
the
same
problem
.
To
reduce
the
risk
of
infections
,
the
center
's
staff
wash
their
own
and
the
children
's
hands
frequently
,
and
provide
each
child
with
his
or
her
own
toys
and
supplies
.
 
""
You
feel
like
you
're
not
the
sick
kid
's
mom
,
""
said
one
child
's
mother
,
Maura
Lewinger
.
""
It
is
nice
because
none
of
the
parents
at
the
center
are
alienated
.
""
 
The
Zuchs
run
the
center
as
a
non-profit
organization
and
any
family
can
bring
their
children
to
the
center
for
free
.
Nancy
Zuch
works
as
the
head
teacher-with
a
little
help
from
her
daughter
Morgan
,
now
l2
years
old
.
Today
,
Morgan
is
strong
and
healthy
,
and
loves
to
provide
support
for
the
children
who
are
going
through
the
difficult
time
that
she
once
went
through
.
She
says
she
wants
to
be
a
teacher
at
the
Morgan
Center
when
she
grows
up

"First
,
welcome
to
West
Lake
!
I
am
glad
to
serve
all
of
you
.
 
Today
you
come
here
,
you
are
sure
to
be
attracted
by
its
beauty
.
Hangzhou
is
famous
for
West
Lake
which
is
a
famous
fresh
water
lake
,
It
lies
in
central
Hangzhou
,
in
Zhejiang
Province
of
eastern
China
.
 
Traditionally
,
there
are
ten
best-known
spots
on
the
West
Lake
.
They
are
called
Ten
Scenes
of
West
Lake
by
Qianlong
Emperor
.
The
West
Lake
is
divided
by
three
causeways
called
Su
Di
,
Bai
Di
,
and
Yanggong
Di
.
First
I
want
to
tell
you
the
history
of
Bai
Di
.
 
In
the
middle
of
the
Tang
Dynasty
,
Zhen
yuan
era
(
785-804
)
,
poet
Bai
Juyi
came
to
Hangzhou
as
a
governor
.
He
realized
that
the
farmland
nearby
depended
on
the
water
of
West
Lake
,
but
the
old
dyke
had
collapsed
,
the
water
of
West
Lake
had
dried
out
,
and
the
local
farmers
suffered
drought
.
He
ordered
the
construction
of
a
causeway
of
a
stronger
and
taller
dyke
to
solve
the
drought
problem
.
The
lives
of
local
people
improved
over
the
following
years
.
Then
Bai
Juyi
had
more
free
time
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
West
Lake
.
He
visited
West
Lake
almost
every
day
.
This
causeway
was
later
named
after
Bai
Di
in
Bai
Juyi
's
honor
.
 
Next
is
Su
Di
.
Spring
Dawn
on
the
Su
Causeway
is
considered
as
the
first
of
ten
scenes
.
It
was
built
by
Su
Dongpo
,
the
great
poet
,
during
the
Noah
Song
Dynasty
.
It
is
very
beautiful
in
spring

"Dogs
and
millionaires
have
a
lot
in
common
.
They
are
absolute
opportunists
(
especially
when
it
comes
to
rewards
)
.
They
defend
their
territory
.
And
in
general
,
they
do
n't
like
cats
.
Perhaps
that
explains
a
new
survey
showing
that
millionaires
are
far
more
dog-friendly
than
the
rest
of
Americans
.
 
According
to
a
study
by
Spectrem
Group
,
58
%
of
millionaire
pet
owners
have
a
dog
.
Only
37
%
own
a
cat
.
Only
3
%
keep
fish
,
2
%
birds
and
2
%
have
a
horse
.
Similarly
,
39
%
of
U.
S.
households
own
a
dog
,
compared
to
33
%
of
households
owning
a
cat
,
released
by
the
Humane
Society
.
 
Jennifer
Cona
,
a
trust
and
estates
attorney
and
partner
with
Genser
Subow
Genser
&
Cona
in
New
York
,
does
a
lot
of
work
on
pet
trusts
.
She
said
of
all
the
pet
trusts
she
's
worked
on
,
90
%
are
for
dogs
and
only
10
%
are
for
cats
.
 
She
said
dogs
provide
one
thing
especially
important
for
the
wealthy
:
unconditional
love
.
 
""
You
do
n't
get
that
from
a
cat
,
""
she
said
,
""
Dogs
are
like
children
for
some
families
,
except
that
they
do
n't
mess
up
in
college
or
run
off
with
money
.
Sometimes
it
's
easy
to
see
why
dogs
are
the
favorite
children
.
""
 
Millionaires
show
their
love
for
their
dogs
in
part
by
their
spending
.
One
quarter
of
millionaire
pet
owners
spend
more
than
$
1
,
000
a
year
on
their
pets
,
the
Spectrem
study
said
,
while
more
than
half
spend
more
than
$
500
a
year
.
 
Many
would
say
those
numbers
are
understated
,
given
all
the
diamond-dog
collars
,
dog
foods
and
booming
dog
spas
in
evidence
these
days
,
not
to
mention
the
medical
bills
.
 
The
survey
showed
34
%
of
pet
owners
spend
money
on
decorating
,
while
6
%
spend
on
""
sweaters
,
outfits
and
costumes
.
""
 
More
than
half
of
millionaire
pet
owners
spend
money
on
teeth
cleaning
for
their
pets
.
More
than
16
%
,
meanwhile
,
said
they
would
spend
money
on
reconstructive
surgeries
and
""
anti-anxiety
,
anti-depression
""
medication
for
their
pets

"One
morning
,
my
husband
Jerry
went
back
to
the
kitchen
as
he
just
finished
loading
his
car
.
""
I
guess
filling
my
thermos
is
all
that
I
have
left
to
do
,
and
then
I
'm
off
.
""
Down
the
drain
went
the
hot
water
that
had
been
warming
his
thermos
.
 
With
a
nostalgic
look
on
his
face
,
he
softly
said
:
""
Anytime
I
fill
my
thermos
I
think
of
your
mom
.
""
The
tone
in
his
voice
was
so
tender
as
he
spoke
of
my
mother
,
who
is
sadly
no
longer
with
us
.
 
""
Oh
honey
,
I
know
she
's
watching
and
listening
right
now
with
a
big
smile
on
her
face
,
""
I
responded
,
tears
in
my
eyes
.
 
One
morning
years
ago
when
we
were
leaving
,
mother
watched
as
Jerry
was
to
fill
his
thermos
.
Mom
then
casually
said
,
'Jerry
,
if
you
filled
your
thermos
with
hot
water
and
let
it
sit
a
while
,
your
coffee
would
stay
hot
for
longer
then
.
""
With
her
simple
suggestion
,
his
face
showed
that
he
was
shocked
by
his
own
lack
of
common
sense
.
Well
,
of
course
it
would
!
 
He
poured
out
the
small
amount
of
coffee
already
in
the
thermos
and
refilled
it
with
boiling
hot
water
.
Then
he
poured
the
water
and
refilled
it
with
hot
coffee
.
Mom
smiled
as
Jerry
did
so
.
 
Words
of
wisdom
from
a
loving
mother-in-law
made
an
impact
that
will
never
be
forgotten
.
She
never
dreamed
her
words
would
be
a
treasured
and
everlasting
memory
in
the
heart
of
her
son-in-law
.
 
The
lasting
memories
don
’
t
necessarily
come
from
major
moments
in
life
.
Memories
are
often
made
during
those
small
,
ordinary
times
.
Life
is
about
small
moments
we
share
with
friends
and
loved
ones

"Even
as
Americans
have
been
gaining
weight
,
they
have
cut
their
average
fat
intake
from
36
to
34
percent
of
their
total
diets
in
the
past
15
years
.
And
indeed
,
cutting
fat
to
control
or
lose
weight
makes
sense
.
Fat
has
nine
calories
per
gram
.
Protein
and
carbohydrates
have
just
four
.
Moreover
,
the
body
uses
fewer
calories
to
metabolize
fat
than
it
does
to
metabolize
other
foods
.
Compared
with
protein
and
carbohydrates
--
which
break
down
into
amino
acids
and
simple
sugars
,
respectively
,
and
can
be
used
to
strengthen
and
energize
the
body
--
--
dietary
fat
is
more
easily
converted
to
body
fat
.
Therefore
,
it
's
more
likely
to
stay
on
buttocks
,
thighs
and
bellies
.
 
But
cutting
fat
from
your
diet
does
n't
necessarily
mean
your
body
wo
n't
store
fat
.
For
example
,
between
nonfat
and
regular
cookies
,
there
's
trivial
difference
in
calories
because
manufacturers
make
up
for
the
loss
of
fat
by
adding
sugar
.
Low-fat
crackers
,
soups
and
dressings
can
also
be
just
as
high
in
calories
as
richer
versions
.
No
matter
where
the
calories
come
from
,
overeating
will
still
cause
weight
again
.
The
calories
from
fat
just
do
it
a
little
quicker
.
A
Wisconsin
computer
programmer
who
decided
with
a
diet
coach
to
eat
only
40
grams
of
fat
a
day
learned
the
lesson
firsthand
.
He
was
n't
losing
weight
.
Then
he
showed
his
food
diary
to
his
coach
and
revealed
he
'd
been
eating
half
a
pound
of
jelly
beans
a
day
.
""
They
do
n't
have
any
fat
,
""
he
explains
.
But
they
had
enough
sugar
to
keep
him
from
shedding
an
ounce
.
 
Nonfat
foods
become
add-on
foods
.
When
we
add
them
to
our
diet
,
we
actually
increase
the
number
of
calories
we
eat
per
day
and
gain
weight
.
That
was
borne
out
in
a
Pennsylvania
State
University
study
.
For
breakfast
,
Prof.
Barbara
Rolls
gave
two
groups
of
women
yogurt
that
contained
exactly
the
same
amount
of
calories
.
One
group
's
yogurt
label
said
""
high
fat
""
--
the
other
,
""
low
fat
.
""
The
""
low
fat
""
yogurt
group
ate
significantly
more
calories
later
in
the
day
than
the
other
group
.
""
People
think
they
've
saved
fat
and
can
indulge
themselves
later
in
the
day
with
no
adverse
consequences
,
""
says
Richard
Mattes
,
a
nutrition
researcher
at
Purdue
University
.
""
But
when
they
do
that
,
they
do
n't
compensate
very
precisely
,
and
they
often
end
up
overdoing
it
.

"First
Lady
Michelle
Obama
is
on
a
five-day
trip
to
Asia
.
She
is
visiting
Japan
and
Cambodia
to
help
publicize
a
program
called
""
Let
Girls
Learn
""
.
Administration
officials
set
up
the
campaign
to
support
the
education
of
millions
of
girls
worldwide
.
 
Before
her
trip
,
Mrs.
Obama
and
her
husband
noted
the
inability
of
an
estimated
62-million
girls
to
attend
school
.
They
said
educating
the
girls
should
be
a
foreign
policy
goal
.
 
This
week
,
Mrs.
Obama
criticized
the
fact
that
tens
of
millions
of
girls
are
not
receiving
a
satisfactory
education
.
In
her
opinion
piece
,
she
wrote
this
failure
to
educate
girls
was
more
than
""
a
tragic
waste
of
potential
.
""
It
is
both
a
serious
public
health
issue
and
a
problem
for
the
economic
health
of
nations
and
the
world
.
She
also
said
it
was
""
a
threat
to
the
security
of
countries
around
the
world
""
.
 
The
First
Lady
noted
by
2012
,
every
part
of
the
developing
world
was
educating
both
girls
and
boys
in
primary
schools
.
But
this
is
not
the
case
in
secondary
education
.
She
wrote
in
some
areas
girls
face
""
the
cultural
values
and
practices
that
limit
the
prospects
of
women
in
their
societies
""
.
 
The
Obama
administration
launched
the
""
Let
Girls
Learn
""
campaign
earlier
this
month
.
At
the
time
,
Mrs.
Obama
noted
plans
to
involve
the
U.S.Peace
Corps
,
and
the
Volunteer
Development
Agency
.
 
""
This
effort
will
draw
on
the
talent
and
energy
of
the
nearly
7,000
Peace
Corps
volunteers
serving
in
more
than
60
countries
.
Through
this
effort
,
Peace
Corps
will
be
supporting
hundreds
of
new
community
projects
to
help
girls
go
to
school
and
stay
in
school
.
And
,
I
want
to
emphasize
that
these
programs
will
be
community-generated
and
community-led
.
They
will
be
based
on
solutions
devised
by
local
leaders
,
families
and
yes
,
even
the
girls
themselves
.
""
 
President
Obama
also
spoke
at
the
same
White
House
event
,
saying
that
campaign
is
important
to
his
administration

"My
dad
,
over
ninety
years
old
now
,
sat
weakly
on
the
bench
.
He
did
n't
move
and
just
sat
with
his
head
down
staring
at
his
hands
.
I
sat
down
beside
him
.
He
did
n't
realize
it
and
the
longer
I
sat
,
the
more
I
wondered
if
he
was
okay
.
Finally
,
not
really
wanting
to
disturb
him
but
wanting
to
check
on
him
,
I
asked
him
if
he
was
okay
.
He
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
me
and
smiled
.
""
Yes
,
I
'm
fine
.
Thank
you
for
asking
,
""
he
said
in
a
clear
strong
voice
.
I
said
,
did
n't
mean
to
disturb
you
,
Dad
,
but
you
were
just
sitting
there
staring
at
your
hands
and
I
wanted
to
make
sure
you
were
alright
.
""
""
Have
you
ever
looked
at
your
hands
?
""
he
asked
.
""
I
mean
really
looked
at
your
hands
?
""
I
slowly
opened
my
hands
and
stared
down
at
them
.
I
turned
them
over
again
and
again
.
 
Dad
smiled
and
said
,
""
Stop
and
think
for
a
moment
about
the
hands
you
have
.
How
have
they
served
you
well
throughout
your
years
?
Though
these
hands
are
thin
and
weak
,
they
have
been
the
tools
I
have
used
all
my
life
.
""
 
""
That
's
right
!
They
caught
my
fall
when
as
a
baby
I
crashed
upon
the
floor
.
They
put
food
in
my
mouth
and
clothes
on
my
back
.
When
I
was
a
little
girl
,
my
mother
taught
me
to
fold
them
to
pray
.
They
tied
my
shoes
and
pulled
on
my
boots
.
They
dried
the
tears
of
my
children
.
They
wiped
my
tears
when
my
son
went
off
to
war
,
""
I
said
.
 
After
that
day
,
I
never
looked
at
my
hands
the
same
again

"A
rainforest
is
an
area
covered
by
tall
trees
with
the
total
high
rainfall
spreading
quite
equally
through
the
year
and
the
temperature
rarely
dipping
below
l6degC
.
Rainforests
have
a
great
effect
on
the
world
environment
because
they
can
take
in
heat
from
the
sun
and
adjust
the
climate
.
Without
the
forest
cover
,
these
areas
would
reflect
more
heat
into
the
atmosphere
,
warming
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Losing
the
rainforests
may
also
influence
wind
and
rainfall
patterns
,
potentially
causing
certain
natural
disasters
all
over
the
world
.
 
In
the
past
hundred
years
,
humans
have
begun
destroying
rainforests
in
search
of
three
major
resources
:
land
for
crops
,
wood
for
paper
and
other
products
,
land
for
raising
farm
animals
.
This
action
affects
the
environment
as
a
whole
.
For
example
,
a
lot
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
air
comes
from
burning
the
rainforests
.
People
obviously
have
a
need
for
the
resources
we
gain
from
cutting
trees
but
we
will
suffer
much
more
than
we
will
benefit
.
 
There
are
two
main
reasons
for
this
.
Firstly
,
when
people
cut
down
trees
,
generally
they
can
only
use
the
land
for
a
year
or
two
.
Secondly
,
cutting
large
sections
of
rainforests
may
provide
a
good
supply
of
wood
right
now
,
but
in
the
long
run
it
actually
reduces
the
world
's
wood
supply
.
 
Rainforests
are
often
called
the
world
's
drug
store
.
More
than
25
%
of
the
medicines
we
use
today
come
from
plants
in
rainforests
.
However
,
fewer
than
l
%
of
rainforest
plants
have
been
examined
for
their
medical
value
.
It
is
extremely
likely
that
our
best
chance
to
cure
diseases
lies
somewhere
in
the
world
's
shrinking
rainforests

"Nathan
's
second-hand
bike
was
good
enough
to
get
him
anywhere
he
wanted
to
go
.
Of
course
,
it
could
n't
match
Tim
's
in
a
normal
speed
race
,
but
all
the
fancy
gears
in
the
world
would
n't
get
you
up
Black
Mountain
.
It
was
so
steep
in
places
that
you
had
to
get
off
your
bike
and
push
.
 
On
this
particular
afternoon
,
the
odds
were
all
on
Nathan
's
side
.
First
,
he
was
stronger
.
Tim
had
always
been
thin
,
but
recently
he
'd
started
to
grow
so
fast
that
his
arms
and
legs
were
like
pieces
of
spaghetti
.
As
well
as
being
considerably
fitter
than
his
friend
,
Nathan
knew
the
shortcuts
up
prefix
=
st1
/BlackMountain
.
 
So
when
Nathan
accepted
the
challenge
,
he
was
sure
he
'd
win
.
He
nearly
always
did
,
in
competitions
with
Tim
.
That
was
what
was
strange
.
Tim
was
so
competitive
,
and
yet
he
was
n't
any
good
at
physical
things
.
 
By
the
time
the
two
boys
were
three
quarters
of
the
way
to
the
top
,
Nathan
was
clearly
ahead
.
While
the
road
zigzagged
back
and
forth
up
the
mountainside
,
in
certain
places
,
there
were
also
vertical
tracks
,
where
water
rushing
down
the
slope
in
winter
had
bitten
erosion
courses
into
the
soil
.
These
had
in
turn
been
so
overgrown
by
bushes
and
long
grass
in
the
spring
that
they
looked
like
tunnels
through
the
bush
.
The
trick
was
to
know
where
you
could
cut
off
a
whole
bend
in
the
road
by
leaving
the
road
and
pushing
your
bike
up
one
of
these
half-hidden
pathways
.
If
you
chose
the
wrong
one
you
'd
struggle
up
for
ten
minutes
and
then
suddenly
reach
a
dead
end
.
Then
there
was
no
choice
but
to
go
back

"When
I
was
struggling
with
cancer
a
few
years
ago
,
my
wife
and
I
formed
our
own
""
couple
caution
circle
""
.
Anytime
a
doctor
came
with
news
of
my
progress
,
my
wife
would
give
me
a
big
hug
.
The
reports
were
seldom
good
during
the
early
stages
of
my
illness
,
and
one
day
a
doctor
brought
particularly
frightening
news
.
Staring
at
my
reports
,
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
""
It
does
n't
look
like
you
're
going
to
make
it
.
""
 
Before
I
could
ask
him
a
question
,
my
wife
stood
up
,
handed
me
my
clothes
,
adjusted
the
tubes
fastened
to
my
body
and
said
,
""
Let
's
get
out
of
here
.
This
man
is
a
risk
to
your
health
.
""
As
she
helped
me
struggle
to
the
door
,
the
doctor
came
near
us
.
""
Stay
back
,
""
demanded
my
wife
.
""
Stay
away
from
us
.
""
 
As
we
walked
together
down
the
hall
,
the
doctor
attempted
to
catch
up
with
us
.
""
Keep
going
,
""
said
my
wife
,
pushing
the
intravenous
stand
.
""
We
're
going
to
talk
to
someone
who
really
knows
what
is
going
on
.
""
Then
she
held
up
her
hand
to
the
doctor
.
""
Do
n't
come
any
closer
to
us
.
""
 
The
two
of
us
moved
as
one
.
We
escaped
to
the
safety
and
hope
of
a
doctor
who
did
not
confuse
diagnosis
with
conclusion
.
I
could
never
have
made
that
walk
toward
wellness
alone

"With
around
100
students
scheduled
to
be
in
that
9:00
am
Monday
morning
lecture
,
it
is
no
surprise
that
almost
20
people
actually
make
it
to
the
class
and
only
10
of
them
are
still
awake
after
the
first
15
minutes
;
it
is
not
even
a
surprise
that
most
of
them
are
still
in
their
pajama
's
.
Obviously
,
students
are
terrible
at
adjusting
their
sleep
cycles
to
their
daily
schedule
.
 
All
human
beings
possess
a
body
clock
.
Along
with
other
alerting
systems
,
this
governs
the
sleep/wake
cycle
and
is
therefore
one
of
the
main
processes
which
govern
sleep
behaviour
.
Typically
,
the
preferred
sleep/wake
cycle
is
delayed
in
adolescents
,
which
leads
to
many
students
not
feeling
sleepy
until
much
later
in
the
evenings
.
This
typical
sleep
pattern
is
usually
referred
to
as
the
""
night
owl
""
schedule
of
sleep
.
 
This
is
opposed
to
the
""
early
bird
""
schedule
,
and
is
a
kind
of
disorder
where
the
individual
tends
to
stay
up
much
past
midnight
.
Such
a
person
has
great
difficulty
in
waking
up
in
the
mornings
.
Research
suggests
that
night
owls
feel
most
alert
and
function
best
in
the
evenings
and
at
night
.
Research
findings
have
shown
that
about
20
percent
of
people
can
be
classified
as
""
night
owls
""
and
only
10
percent
can
be
classified
as
""
early
birds
""
--
--
--
the
other
70
percent
are
in
the
middle
.
Although
this
is
clearly
not
true
for
all
students
,
for
the
ones
who
are
true
night
owls
,
this
gives
them
an
excellent
excuse
for
missing
their
lectures
which
unfortunately
fall
before
midday

"As
my
dad
unwrapped
the
new
bicycle
helmet
that
I
got
him
for
his
birthday
,
I
realized
that
a
number
of
people
ride
their
bicycles
every
day
without
the
protection
of
a
helmet
.
 
Due
to
cold
winters
across
the
country
,
riding
has
become
increasingly
dangerous
as
many
roads
have
potholes
and
are
torn-up
.
Not
everyone
realizes
that
there
are
laws
requiring
the
wearing
of
helmets
in
many
places
.
 
Where
I
live
,
there
has
been
a
law
in
place
since
October
1
,
1992
stating
that
cyclists
of
all
ages
are
required
to
wear
helmets
.
Unfortunately
,
accidents
can
happen
to
the
best
of
riders
.
My
dad
has
been
a
cyclist
for
many
years
,
and
he
often
rides
around
my
county
and
to
Rockland
Lake
State
Park
.
 
One
afternoon
,
as
he
was
just
entering
the
park
,
he
lost
control
of
his
bicycle
and
flew
off
and
landed
on
a
nearby
patch
of
grass
,
breaking
his
helmet
into
pieces
and
losing
consciousness
.
When
he
was
just
awakening
,
a
lovely
couple
found
him
and
brought
him
back
to
our
house
,
where
he
attempted
to
recap
the
events
leading
up
to
his
fall
.
Later
that
day
,
a
CAT
scan
showed
that
he
had
a
concussion
.
That
evening
,
while
my
dad
was
showing
me
the
pieces
of
his
broken
helmet
,
_
.
 
If
he
had
not
worn
his
helmet
,
he
probably
would
have
cracked
his
skull
and
perhaps
died
.
Today
,
when
my
dad
and
I
go
out
cycling
,
the
wearing
of
our
helmets
is
not
even
a
question
.
Regardless
of
age
,
everyone
should
wear
a
helmet
whenever
they
get
on
a
bicycle

"Time
spent
in
a
bookshop
can
be
most
enjoyable
,
whether
you
are
a
book-lover
or
only
there
to
buy
a
book
as
a
present
.
You
may
even
have
entered
the
shop
just
to
hide
from
a
sudden
rain
.
Whatever
the
reason
,
you
can
soon
totally
unaware
of
your
surroundings
.
You
soon
become
interested
in
some
books
or
others
,
and
usually
it
is
only
much
later
that
you
realize
you
have
spent
too
much
time
there
and
have
to
rush
off
to
keep
some
forgotten
appointment
.
 
This
chance
to
escape
the
realities
of
everyday
life
is
the
main
attraction
of
a
bookshop
.
A
music
shop
is
very
much
like
a
bookshop
.
You
can
walk
around
such
a
place
for
as
long
as
you
like
.
If
it
is
a
good
shop
,
no
assistant
will
come
up
to
you
with
the
greeting
""
Can
I
help
you
?
""
You
need
n't
buy
anything
you
do
n't
want
.
In
a
bookshop
an
assistant
should
remain
in
the
background
until
you
have
finished
reading
.
Then
,
and
only
then
,
are
his
services
necessary
.
 
Once
a
medical
student
had
to
read
a
textbook
which
was
far
too
expensive
for
him
to
buy
.
He
could
n't
borrow
it
from
the
library
and
the
only
copy
he
could
find
was
in
a
certain
bookshop
.
Every
afternoon
,
therefore
,
he
would
go
along
to
the
shop
and
read
a
little
of
the
book
at
a
time
.
One
day
,
however
,
he
was
disappointed
to
find
the
book
missing
from
his
usual
place
.
He
was
about
to
leave
,
when
he
noticed
the
owner
of
the
shop
beckoning
to
him
.
Expecting
to
be
told
off
,
he
went
towards
him
.
To
his
surprise
,
the
owner
pointed
to
the
book
which
was
put
away
in
a
comer
.
""
I
put
it
there
so
that
nobody
would
try
to
buy
it
!
""
He
said
,
and
left
the
delighted
student
continuing
his
reading

"Language
is
a
major
problem
for
the
European
Union
(
EU
)
.
The
agreement
or
treaty
which
created
the
organization
that
eventually
became
the
EU
,
the
Treaty
of
Rome
,
stated
that
each
country
's
language
must
be
treated
equally
.
The
original
six
countries
had
only
three
languages
between
them
:
French
.
German
and
Dutch/Flemish
.
However
,
there
are
now
15
countries
in
the
EU
,
with
a
total
of
12
languages
.
EU
documents
must
be
translated
into
all
these
languages
,
and
at
official
meetings
the
speeches
must
be
translated
into
all
the
languages
by
interpreters
.
 
All
this
translating
is
very
expensive
and
time-consuming
.
it
is
said
that
nearly
half
of
all
employees
of
the
EU
are
engaged
in
translating
documents
and
speeches
,
and
nearly
half
of
the
EU
's
administrative
costs
are
spent
on
this
task
.
In
the
near
future
it
is
probably
that
several
more
countries
,
most
of
them
having
their
own
languages
,
will
join
the
EU
,
thus
making
the
situation
even
worse
.
 
The
problem
is
not
just
cost
:
there
are
practical
difficulties
as
well
.
With
12
languages
,
there
are
132
possible
""
translation
situations
""
that
might
be
needed
.
It
is
often
'
difficult
to
find
people
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
who
can
translate
from
(
for
example
)
Danish
into
Greek
,
or
Dutch
into
Portuguese
,
at
a
high
professional
standard
.
 
In
practice
the
problem
has
been
made
less
serious
by
the
use
of
English
in
many
contacts
between
EU
officials
,
since
almost
all
of
them
speak
some
English
.
However
,
any
move
to
reduce
the
number
of
official
languages
(
perhaps
to
four
or
five
)
would
be
a
blow
to
the
pride
of
the
smaller
countries
.
Another
commonly
suggested
solution
is
to
make
English
the
official
language
for
all
EU
business
.
However
,
powerful
member
countries
like
France
and
Germany
are
strongly
against
it

"If
you
like
bicycling
as
much
as
you
like
playing
ball
and
ca
n't
seem
to
decide
between
the
two
sports
,
you
may
want
to
consider
cycle
ball
--
a
fun
sport
that
adopts
the
key
attributes
from
both
activities
and
transforms
it
into
a
totally
new
game..
 
Also
known
as
red
ball
,
the
game
was
invented
in
1893
by
German
laborers
who
wished
to
play
polo
,
but
could
not
afford
horses
.
While
the
sport
has
not
caught
on
in
North
America
,
it
is
very
fashionable
in
Europe
and
even
Japan
.
 
Played
in
an
indoor
court
,
cycle
ball
is
similar
to
soccer
in
many
ways
--
the
aim
is
to
score
as
many
goals
as
possible
,
and
only
the
goalkeeper
is
allowed
to
touch
the
ball
.
 
The
one
big
difference
?
Use
of
legs
is
forbidden
.
Instead
,
players
have
to
guide
the
ball
across
the
court
,
using
the
front
wheels
of
their
bicycles
or
with
their
heads
.
In
fact
,
if
a
player
even
touches
the
floor
with
his
feet
during
the
14-minute
game
,
it
is
considered
a
foul
and
the
opposing
team
gets
a
free
kick
.
 
While
the
game
was
initially
played
with
normal
bikes
,
things
are
a
little
different
now
.
The
seats
of
these
specialized
bikes
are
positioned
over
the
back
tire
and
they
sport
a
single
fixed
gear
,
making
it
easier
for
the
rider
to
control
the
constant
back
and
forth
movement
required
for
the
game
.
The
handlebars
also
point
straight
up
so
that
the
competitors
can
sit
upright
while
playing
and
they
are
about
twice
the
weight
of
normal
bikes
,
which
helps
with
the
stability
.
 
While
cycle
ball
may
sound
a
little
strange
,
it
is
a
fast-paced
sport
that
requires
much
training
,
skill
,
and
,
is
also
really
fun
to
watch

"For
many
years
,
a
small
percentage
of
homeowners
have
fixed
solar
panels
on
their
rooftops
.
Those
panels
collect
some
of
the
sun
's
energy
and
either
change
it
into
electricity
or
use
it
to
heat
water
.
Until
recently
,
the
panels
were
too
expensive
for
average
homeowners
,
and
their
designs
were
not
attractive
.
Thanks
to
new
advances
,
however
,
solar
panels
for
homes
are
becoming
cheaper
and
less
large
and
heavy
.
Now
more
homeowners
are
considering
using
them
.
 
Stores
begin
to
sell
Solar
panels
 
Last
fall
furniture
retailer
IKEA
began
selling
solar
panels
in
its
U.K.
stores
.
IKEA
has
brought
the
DIY
solar
choice
to
the
public
.
While
shopping
for
furniture
,
shoppers
could
not
add
a
box
or
two
of
solar
panels
to
their
shopping
cart
.
IKEA
is
partnering
with
a
company
.
The
company
deals
with
fixing
and
servcing
of
the
solar
panels
on
the
roofs
.
So
it
is
easy
for
customers
to
change
from
old
energy
system
to
solar
system
.
If
all
goes
well
,
IKEA
plans
to
begin
selling
the
panels
in
other
countries
soon
.
 
Stylish
solar
panels
 
SolTech
,
a
Swedish
company
,
offers
a
really
great
solar-power
solution
.
Instead
of
flat
panels
,
SolTech
covers
the
panels
with
a
special
glass
tile
.
And
the
shape
of
the
glass
tile
fits
traditional
tiled
roof
designs
.
SolTech
recently
offers
solar
systems
that
heat
the
home
's
air
or
water
.
And
it
also
offers
one
solar
system
that
produces
electricity
.
 
Turning
windows
into
solar
panels
 
New
technology
has
turned
windows
into
solar
panels
.
SolarWindow
technology
enables
see-through
windows
to
produce
electricity
after
the
glass
surface
is
added
with
a
special
coating
.
Amazingly
,
SolarWindow
can
produce
electricity
in
low-light
conditons
and
can
even
turn
indoor
,
man-made
light
into
electricity
!
Since
buildings
are
getting
taller
and
about
60
percent
of
an
office
building
's
surface
is
covered
with
windows
,
solar
window
could
become
a
very
popular
way
for
people
to
produce
energy
and
save
money
.
 
Turning
your
home
-business-into
a
solar-powered
one
is
a
choice
that
's
becoming
a
lot
more
attractive
these
days

"Could
radar
be
the
answer
to
keeping
an
eye
on
elderly
people
without
invading
their
privacy
?
That
's
what
the
researchers
are
aiming
to
prove
with
their
experiment
.
They
say
using
radar
could
keep
track
of
older
s
and
even
detect
when
they
fall
over
.
 
Right
now
,
40
million
Americans
are
over
the
age
of
65
,
and
the
Census
Bureau
predicts
that
by
the
year
2030
,
80
million
Americans
will
be
65
or
older
.
Due
to
these
rising
statistics
,
families
,
communities
and
health
care
providers
are
at
a
cross-road
in
terms
of
how
to
best
serve
this
growing
aging
population
.
 
Many
elderly
individuals
choose
to
live
alone
,
which
causes
a
great
risk
as
falls
and
other
illnesses
become
more
likely
as
a
person
ages
.
In
order
to
increase
the
safety
and
security
of
an
elderly
person
living
alone
,
researchers
are
examining
the
use
of
through-the-wall
radar
technology
to
detect
falls
and
monitor
the
elderly
in
their
individual
living
spaces
.
 
Graduate
students
were
trained
in
walking
,
falling
,
and
functioning
like
an
elderly
person
and
experiments
were
conducted
in
the
radar-imaging
lab
on
the
campus
.
A
clinical
instructor
and
an
expert
educated
and
trained
the
students
on
how
the
elderly
carry
themselves
and
walk
--
with
or
without
the
assistance
of
canes
or
walkers
.
 
Their
research
focuses
on
various
applications
for
radar
imaging
,
including
search
and
rescue
,
defense
,
and
law
enforcement
.
Dr
Amin
and
his
team
,
through
a
grant
from
Qatar
University
,
are
now
developing
a
series
of
algorithms
to
identify
the
patterns
and
routines
of
an
elderly
person
in
his
or
her
home
.
 
The
radar
,
with
the
help
of
these
algorithms
,
can
detect
when
a
person
is
sitting
,
standing
,
walking
and
so
on
.
They
say
detection
of
motion
,
and
even
classification
of
what
sort
of
motion
it
is
(
such
as
walking
or
falling
)
,
can
be
achieved
in
all
rooms
inside
a
home
with
just
one
or
a
few
radar
units
.
 
""
Radar
has
become
a
mature
technology
,
""
explains
Dr
Amin
.
""
So
people
have
started
thinking
about
transitioning
this
technology
into
healthcare
.

"Two
new
electronic
book
products
(
the
SoftBook
and
the
PocketBook
)
have
gathered
extensive
press
coverage
,
including
articles
in
ABC
News
,
the
New
York
Times
,
San
Jose
Mercury
News
,
and
WIRED
.
 
An
electronic
book
(
e-book
)
is
a
book-length
publication
in
digital
form
,
consisting
of
text
,
images
,
or
both
,
and
produced
on
,
published
through
,
and
readable
on
computers
or
other
electronic
devices
.
Different
from
a
traditional
printed
book
,
e-books
are
born
digital
.
 
Being
a
firm
believer
in
tablet
computers
for
many
tasks
not
involving
heavy
data
entry
,
I
applaud
these
new
designs
of
the
products
.
In
particular
,
the
SoftBook
has
nice
leather
binding
,
going
far
beyond
the
traditional
(
and
boring
)
industrial
design
used
for
other
portable
computers
.
The
PocketBook
has
a
more
traditional
industrial
design
,
typical
of
leading
electronic
gadgets
.
 
Unfortunately
,
neither
company
mentions
their
product
's
screen
resolution
.
Low-resolution
monitors
(
including
all
computer
screens
until
now
)
have
poor
readability
:
people
read
about
25
%
slower
from
computer
screens
than
from
printed
paper
.
Scientists
believe
that
only
the
screen
with
300
dpi
displays
has
the
same
reading
speed
as
print
.
So
unless
they
have
much
better
screens
,
electronic
books
will
have
a
problem
.
 
A
project
called
""
the
last
book
""
is
getting
much
attention
,
which
aims
at
producing
a
computer
in
the
form
of
a
folio
:
a
set
of
pages
using
""
digital
ink
""
.
Users
would
move
forward
in
the
information
by
turning
pages
just
as
they
do
in
a
printed
book
.
Hopefully
,
the
scientists
will
eventually
invent
a
way
to
make
the
""
digital
ink
""
display
characters
at
a
high
enough
resolution
to
gain
the
same
reading
speed
as
print
.
 
Even
when
e-books
gain
the
same
reading
speed
as
print
,
they
will
still
be
a
bad
idea
.
Page
turning
remains
a
bad
interface
,
even
when
it
can
be
done
more
conveniently
than
by
clicking
the
mouse
on
a
""
next
page
""
button
.
 
Another
problem
is
that
most
e-book
publishers
do
not
warn
their
customers
about
the
real
meaning
of
the
digital
rights
management
(
DRM
)
tied
to
their
products
.
Generally
they
claim
that
it
is
meant
to
prevent
copying
of
the
e-book
.
However
,
in
many
cases
it
is
also
possible
that
it
will
result
in
the
complete
denial
of
access
by
the
purchaser
to
the
e-book
.
The
e-book
is
tied
to
a
specific
computer
or
device
.
In
these
cases
,
the
DRM
will
usually
let
the
purchaser
move
the
book
a
limited
number
of
times
after
which
they
can
not
use
it
on
any
additional
devices
.
If
the
purchaser
upgrades
or
replaces
their
devices
,
they
may
lose
access
to
their
purchase
.
Some
forms
of
the
DRM
depend
on
the
existence
of
online
services
to
authenticate
the
purchasers
.
When
the
company
that
provides
the
service
goes
out
of
business
or
decides
to
stop
providing
the
service
,
the
purchaser
will
no
longer
be
able
to
access
the
e-book

say
it
first
and
your
partner
does
n't
love
you
back
?
Or
if
they
do
say
it
but
you
do
n't
feel
they
mean
it
?
Being
the
first
to
declare
your
love
can
be
never
racking
and
risky
and
can
leave
you
feeling
as
vulnerable
as
a
turtle
with
no
shell
.
But
is
the
person
who
says
it
first
really
in
a
position
of
weakness
?
Does
n't
it
pay
to
hold
back
,
play
it
cool
and
wait
until
the
other
half
has
shown
their
hand
faster
?
 
""
A
really
good
relationship
should
be
about
being
fair
and
being
equal
,
""
says
psychologist
Sidney
Crown
.
""
But
love
is
seldom
equal
.
""
""
All
relationships
go
through
power
struggles
but
,
""
he
says
,
""
if
a
love
imbalance
continues
for
years
,
the
rot
will
set
in
.
""
That
feeling
of
""
I
've
always
loved
you
more
""
may
be
subverted
for
a
time
,
but
it
never
goes
away
completely
and
it
often
emerges
in
squabbling
.
In
love
,
at
least
,
the
silent
,
withholding
type
is
not
always
the
most
powerful
.
""
The
strongest
one
in
a
relationship
is
often
the
person
who
feels
confident
enough
to
talk
about
their
feelings
,
""
says
educational
psychologist
Ingrid
Collins
.
Psychosexual
therapist
Paula
Hall
agrees
.
""
The
one
with
the
upper
hand
is
often
the
person
who
takes
the
initiative
.
""
In
fact
,
the
person
who
says
""
I
love
you
""
first
may
also
be
the
one
who
says
""
I
'm
bored
with
you
'
first
.
""
Hall
believes
that
much
depends
on
how
""
I
love
you
""
is
said
and
the
motivation
of
the
person
saying
it
.
Is
it
said
when
they
're
drunk
?
Is
it
said
before
their
partner
flies
off
on
holiday
,
and
what
it
really
means
is
""
Please
don
'
t
be
unfaithful
to
me
""
?
By
saying
""
I
love
you
""
,
they
are
really
saying
""
Do
you
love
me
?
""
If
so
,
would
n't
it
just
be
more
honest
to
say
that
.
Collins
agrees
that
intention
is
everything
.
""
It
's
not
what
is
said
,
but
how
it
's
said
.
What
it
comes
down
to
is
the
sincerity
of
the
speaker
.

"It
was
almost
six
years
ago
that
my
family
and
I
waited
for
her
at
the
airport
.
Unsure
of
what
to
expect
and
a
little
bitter
about
such
an
experience
that
my
mother
was
forcing
upon
me
,
I
had
mixed
feeling
about
the
girl
from
Madrid
.
Today
,
after
making
many
memories
and
discoveries
,
I
could
n't
be
more
thankful
for
what
that
experience
taught
me
.
 
My
family
had
the
privilege
to
host
Teresa
for
several
summers
.
I
became
fond
of
her
cheerful
chatter
,
constant
laughter
,
and
addiction
to
online
shopping
.
She
seldom
took
my
unkind
jokes
seriously
and
always
gave
it
right
back
to
me
,
making
our
relationship
closer
.
She
could
go
on
talking
for
hours
about
the
beach
outside
her
house
,
her
family
and
friends
,
and
her
life
at
her
school
.
 
While
several
aspects
were
very
similar
to
my
life
here
,
I
was
always
left
with
a
certain
level
of
mystery
and
excitement
as
I
wondered
how
the
picture
in
my
head
compared
with
reality
.
 
Through
hard
work
,
she
became
fluent
in
English
in
almost
no
time
.
While
this
was
a
big
success
for
her
,
it
made
me
ashamed
as
I
was
not
forced
to
develop
the
little
Spanish
that
I
was
learning
in
class
.
This
experience
aroused
my
interest
in
traveling
to
Europe
-
especially
Spain
.
While
l
know
that
not
everyone
has
this
same
interest
in
other
culture
,
I
believe
that
it
is
important
for
us
to
be
willing
to
learn
about
what
makes
certain
customs
and
activities
significant
to
them
As
Americans
,
we
may
be
some
of
the
most
arrogant
people
about
other
culture
,
which
history
has
proven
can
have
disastrous
consequences
.
By
at
least
making
the
effort
to
appreciate
what
is
important
to
them
,
we
show
respect
to
the
people
who
have
such
culture
.
 
Through
the
unique
experience
that
in
a
sense
I
was
forced
into
,
I
learned
far
more
about
the
Spanish
culture
than
I
could
have
in
any
classroom
.
I
discovered
new
interests
that
I
had
never
considered
before
,
and
I
am
excited
for
the
opportunity
to
experience
it
first-hand
this
summer

"Nowadays
,
studying
abroad
gains
popularity
in
China
.
Many
parents
would
rather
send
their
children
abroad
to
receive
education
than
let
them
be
educated
in
China
.
 
Every
coin
has
two
sides
and
studying
abroad
is
no
exception
.
There
are
advantages
for
people
to
attend
school
abroad
.
In
the
first
place
,
he
can
use
the
foreign
language
in
his
daily
life
so
that
his
ability
in
the
second
language
may
be
greatly
improved
,
as
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
no
better
opportunity
to
improve
second
language
skills
than
living
in
the
country
where
it
is
spoken
.
While
studying
in
a
foreign
country
,
he
will
mostly
meet
many
others
from
overseas
and
it
is
possible
to
make
friends
with
people
from
all
over
the
world
.
This
is
not
only
exciting
on
the
social
level
,
but
could
lead
to
important
overseas
contacts
in
his
career
as
well
.
He
can
learn
the
latest
knowledge
in
science
and
make
use
of
the
first-rate
facilities
available
.
In
this
way
,
there
are
many
chances
for
him
to
widen
his
horizons
and
broaden
his
mind
.
 
Of
course
,
attending
school
abroad
may
bring
about
a
series
of
problems
as
well
.
The
most
serious
problem
is
language
barrier
.
Not
all
of
the
students
who
plan
to
go
abroad
are
good
at
the
language
spoken
there
.
As
a
result
,
on
arriving
there
,
they
will
find
it
difficult
to
understand
what
the
teachers
say
.
Besides
,
for
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
customs
of
the
local
people
,
they
may
constantly
run
into
trouble
in
dealing
with
various
situations
.
Furthermore
,
the
tuition
and
the
cost
of
living
are
much
higher
than
those
in
our
country
,
which
may
add
more
burdens
to
their
family
.
 
Therefore
,
given
an
opportunity
to
attend
a
school
abroad
,
one
must
consider
both
its

"Star
Wars
Millennium
Falcon
 
This
is
a
gift
that
,
if
we
're
being
honest
,
many
dads
want
to
own
for
themselves
.
This
huge
ship
is
the
greatest
Star
Wars
toy
.
It
lights
up
and
makes
some
noises
.
Every
boy
from
3
to
53
will
absolutely
like
it
,
if
they
can
find
room
for
it
.
I
dare
say
even
a
few
grandfathers
might
go
for
it
.
 
Biscuit
--
the
Loving
Pup
 
You
may
clearly
know
that
a
pet
can
be
a
great
thing
to
a
child
's
development
but
you
probably
do
n't
think
that
you
can
take
care
of
a
dog
properly
.
The
robot
dog
Biscuit
is
less
likely
to
 
the
disorder
of
your
house
and
except
for
a
few
dead
batteries
,
wo
n't
leave
any
surprises
on
the
floor
.
It
will
be
a
good
playmate
for
your
kids
.
 
JVC
KD-10
Headphones
 
It
's
increasingly
common
for
kids
to
enjoy
themselves
on
long
journeys
with
a
portable
DVD
player
or
an
iPod
MP3
,
but
the
headphones
that
come
with
expensive
electronics
are
seldom
suitable
for
young
ears
.
Kids
should
use
JVC
headphones
that
have
a
sound
limiter
that
can
be
set
by
the
concerned
parent
.
 
Sparrow-kids
Routemaster
Kit
 
Sparrow-kids
Kit
makes
a
huge
range
of
craft
tools
.
There
are
lots
of
pretty
but
achievable
projects
for
young
girls
to
take
up
their
(
safe
plastic
)
needles
and
sew
.
 
Holz
Wooden
Airport
 
It
might
be
said
that
Britain
does
n't
need
another
airport
but
when
it
's
a
traditional
wooden
toy
like
this
all
of
you
would
agree
that
it
's
a
good
thing
.
Treated
with
a
little
care
,
this
play-set
could
easily
entertain
your
young
air
traffic
controllers

"Every
day
when
I
enter
the
classroom
,
I
will
take
a
look
at
the
wall
beside
my
seat
.
You
will
find
nothing
special
about
this
old
wall
if
you
just
look
at
it
.
But
for
the
students
in
my
class
,
it
is
a
special
wall
.
Take
a
good
look
at
it
,
and
you
will
get
to
know
the
real
feelings
and
thoughts
of
us
,
the
9th
graders
.
 
In
the
middle
of
the
wall
,
there
is
a
big
""
VICTORY
""
.
It
was
written
in
pencil
.
I
guess
it
must
have
been
written
by
someone
who
got
a
good
mark
in
an
exam
.
 
A
little
higher
above
the
formulas
,
there
is
a
poem
.
It
only
has
two
sentences
.
It
reads
:
All
those
sweet
memories
have
disappeared
.
Like
tears
dropping
in
the
heavy
rain
.
Oh
!
It
must
have
been
written
at
the
end
of
the
last
semester
in
middle
school
.
Classmates
had
to
leave
school
and
good
friends
had
to
part
.
What
a
sad
poem
!
 
If
you
""
explore
""
the
wall
more
carefully
,
you
will
find
many
other
interesting
things
,
like
a
crying
face
,
or
a
happy
face
,
and
other
patterns
.
There
are
still
some
patterns
and
letters
that
I
ca
n't
understand
,
but
they
all
show
the
feeling
of
the
students
who
drew
them
.
 
For
years
,
the
wall
has
witnessed
all
the
things
that
have
happened
in
the
classroom
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
will
be
next
year
,
two
years
from
now
,
or
even
ten
years
from
now
.
But
I
hope
more
smiling
faces
will
be
drawn
on
it

"Are
you
always
unwilling
to
do
housework
and
cleaning
for
no
reason
?
Well
,
you
will
be
happy
today
.
Today
is
No
Housework
Day
.
It
's
time
to
forget
about
housework
and
be
relaxed
.
 
No
Housework
Day
is
always
on
April
7th
.
It
is
your
chance
to
do
anything
,
except
housework
.
Better
still
,
have
someone
else
do
housework
for
a
day
.
Housework
is
a
daily
and
endless
job
and
most
people
think
it
's
boring
to
do
housework
.
I
have
many
friends
and
their
wish
is
to
stay
away
from
housework
.
In
fact
,
their
wish
can
never
come
true
.
 
Do
you
know
how
to
celebrate
No
Housework
Day
?
Well
,
there
are
two
different
ways
.
 
If
you
usually
do
the
housework
around
the
house
,
forget
it
on
this
day
.
Instead
,
kick
back
and
enjoy
the
day
.
Relax
and
do
anything
,
except
housework
.
 
If
you
never
do
housework
,
you
can
do
it
for
your
family
.
It
gives
your
parents
a
break
from
the
housework
.
And
,
you
just
might
get
a
chance
to
know
how
much
housework
your
parents
need
to
do
every
day

"People
usually
talk
about
two
groups
of
colours
:
warm
colours
and
cool
colours
.
Scientists
think
that
there
are
also
two
kinds
of
people
:
people
who
prefer
warm
colours
and
people
who
prefer
cool
colours
.
The
warm
colours
are
red
,
orange
and
yellow
.
Where
there
are
warm
colours
and
a
lot
of
lights
,
people
usually
want
to
be
active
.
People
think
that
red
,
for
example
,
is
exciting
.
Sociable
people
,
those
who
like
to
be
with
others
,
like
red
.
Scientists
also
find
that
warm
colours
can
produce
a
comfortable
feeling
and
that
time
seems
to
pass
quickly
in
a
room
with
warm
colours
than
with
cool
colours
.
So
a
warm
colour
,
such
as
red
or
orange
,
is
a
good
choice
for
a
living
room
or
restaurant
.
 
The
cool
colours
are
green
,
blue
and
violet
.
These
colours
,
unlike
warm
colours
,
are
relaxing
.
Where
there
are
cool
colours
,
people
are
usually
quiet
.
People
who
like
to
spend
time
alone
often
prefer
blue
.
Cool
colours
are
better
for
offices
because
it
can
make
people
who
are
working
feel
relaxed
and
calm

"Not
having
done
physical
exercise
for
some
time
,
I
found
myself
a
little
low-spirited
and
could
n't
study
efficiently
,
so
I
decided
to
do
some
running
the
next
day
.
At
6:15
the
next
morning
,
my
alarm
clock
rang
.
Unwilling
to
rise
from
my
bed
,
I
turned
it
off
and
went
back
to
sleep
.
However
,
5
minutes
later
,
I
struggled
to
get
up
.
After
washing
and
brushing
,
I
had
my
sneakers
on
and
went
out
.
 
Wow
!
The
air
was
so
fresh
that
I
could
n't
help
breathing
it
deeply
.
I
stretched
my
arms
and
legs
,
then
started
to
run
.
I
found
all
things
around
me
were
so
attractive
.
Look
,
the
branches
were
waving
,
as
if
they
were
welcoming
me
;
the
blossoming
flowers
were
bowing
,
with
shyness
,
just
like
girls
.
Listen
,
the
wind
was
whispering
,
as
if
to
say
""
come
on
,
girl
""
.
What
's
more
interesting
was
those
two
birds
,
perching
in
the
tree
.
They
were
scared
and
flew
away
when
I
passed
them
.
""
Hey
,
chaps
,
relax
.
""
I
shouted
without
stopping
running
.
""
Let
's
enjoy
the
beautiful
morning
together
!
""
Then
miracle
happened
.
The
two
little
creatures
seemed
to
understand
what
I
said
.
They
turned
back
and
twittered
around
me
.
""
Are
you
singing
for
me
?
""
I
asked
.
They
twittered
again
and
again
,
sounded
like
""
Yes
""
.
I
was
delighted
to
hear
that
.
Ah
,
what
a
wonderful
morning
and
how
beautiful
life
is
!
 
Actually
,
there
are
a
lot
of
charming
things
around
us
.
Helen
Keller
wrote
in
her
famous
article
Three
Days
to
See
,
""
The
seeing
see
little
""
.
Indeed
,
many
of
us
ignore
the
beauty
around
us
,
just
because
we
are
familiar
with
them
.
They
always
complain
that
life
is
boring
.
But
,
I
just
want
to
say
,
if
you
live
each
day
with
appreciation
of
things
around
,
you
'll
find
life
is
very
charming
.
So
,
let
's
enjoy
life
from
now
on

"Your
children
's
teacher
will
be
providing
extra
time
for
test
preparation
.
This
school
year
's
test
will
be
held
on
January
8
and
9
.
The
test
preparation
time
is
open
to
all
students
,
and
we
strongly
encourage
your
children
to
attend
.
 
This
year
we
are
changing
the
time
for
our
test
preparation
:
it
will
be
on
Thursday
mornings
from
8:10
to
8:50
.
This
helps
children
who
ride
the
bus
and
can
not
stay
for
the
after-school
period
.
It
also
helps
avoid
conflicts
with
after-school
activities
.
 
Danielle
and
Marina
will
be
working
with
the
recent
new
test
takers
6
days
on
the
following
Thursdays
:
15th
,
Nov
;
29th
,
Nov
;
6th
,
Dec
;
13th
,
Dec.
;
20th
,
Dec.
and
3rd
,
Jan
.
 
Besides
the
test
preparation
lectures
on
these
dates
,
teachers
are
already
putting
test
preparation
into
their
usual
courses
.
We
are
finding
that
we
can
help
our
students
to
be
both
skillful
and
whole-hearted
readers
and
test
takers
--
after
all
,
we
all
know
that
the
best
test
preparation
is
good
reading
and
writing
training
.
 
What
can
you
do
at
home
?
Again
,
the
best
and
most
effective
test
preparation
for
the
ELA
test
is
reading
and
more
reading
.
The
research
is
quite
clear
--
students
who
do
well
in
the
tests
are
those
who
are
good
readers
.
Reading
not
only
builds
reading
ability
,
it
also
helps
build
confidence
--
important
for
successful
test
taking
!
But
do
discourage
your
children
from
spending
too
much
time
on
books
that
are
too
hard
or
even
a
bit
too
hard
.
Children
best
develop
comprehension
skills
when
they
are
reading
books
just
right
for
them
(
too
easy
does
n't
hurt
here
either
)
.
 
Finally
,
on
Friday
,
December
7
,
we
will
have
a
morning
lecture
on
the
ELA
.
Please
pay
attention

"Certain
plants
and
animals
can
survive
under
what
seem
like
impossible
conditions
.
Blind
fish
live
freely
under
ocean
depths
that
are
ly
dark
and
cold
.
Bacteria
live
at
temperatures
of
600
degF
or
a
higher
in
places
where
the
heat
comes
from
the
deep
earth
.
One
of
the
most
remarkable
achievements
that
we
can
observe
directly
is
the
ability
of
the
plants
and
animals
in
the
desert
.
 
In
the
Death
Valley
,
temperatures
of
134
degF
in
the
shade
have
been
officially
reported
Yet
lizards
live
there
,
along
with
600
species
of
plants
,
30
species
of
mammals
?
and
even
fish
.
While
the
days
are
terribly
hot
,
the
nights
are
extremely
cold
.
Temperatures
can
fall
down
by
as
much
as
50
degF
.
 
Plants
called
xerophytes
are
perfectly
adapted
to
the
extremely
dry
conditions
.
These
plants
have
survived
by
developing
techniques
for
coping
with
their
environment
.
Like
all
living
things
,
they
must
have
water
,
and
they
get
it
in
several
ways
.
 
The
mesquite
and
the
prickly
pear
pick
up
moisture
in
opposite
ways
.
The
mesquite
sends
its
roots
down
as
deep
as
60
feet
to
tap
the
water
table
.
The
prickly
pear
,
on
the
other
hand
,
spreads
its
roots
wide
.
These
roots
are
shallow
but
they
pick
up
whatever
moisture
is
available
at
ground
level
.
The
paloverde
saves
water
by
shedding
leaves
in
times
of
extreme
drought
The
barrel
cactus
makes
sure
of
a
water
supply
by
storing
water
in
the
plant
itself
.
The
saguaro
cactus
stores
so
much
water
that
it
can
survive
years
of
drought
.
But
even
the
saguaro
will
die
sooner
or
later
if
there
is
no
rain
.
All
these
plants
,
although
well
adjusted
to
their
environment
,
must
eventually
get
water
.
 
Even
if
the
parent
plants
die
,
there
are
always
seeds
to
keep
the
species
alive
.
Since
the
desert
is
so
tough
,
thousands
of
seeds
must
be
released
to
produce
one
plant
.
To
get
rooted
,
these
seeds
must
have
exactly
the
right
conditions
.
They
can
lie
dormant
for
months
,
even
years
,
until
a
little
water
stimulates
the
sparks
of
life

"Andy
is
the
most
unreasonable
,
pigheaded
life
form
in
the
world
,
and
he
makes
me
so
angry
I
could
scream
!
Of
course
,
I
love
him
like
a
brother
.
I
have
to
because
he
is
my
brother
.
More
than
that
,
he
is
my
twin
!
That
's
right
.
Andy
and
Amy
(
that
's
me
)
have
the
same
curly
hair
and
dark
eyes
and
equally
stubborn
character
.
Yet
,
though
we
may
look
alike
,
on
most
issues
we
usually
take
completely
opposite
positions
.
If
I
say
day
,
you
can
count
on
Andy
to
say
night
.
 
Just
this
week
,
the
hot
topic
in
school
was
all
about
the
PTA
'S
proposal
to
adopt
a
school
dress
principle
.
Every
student
would
be
required
to
wear
a
uniform
.
Uniforms
!
Can
you
imagine
?
Oh
,
they
would
be
uniforms
in
color
.
The
dress
style
would
be
sort
of
loose
and
free
.
 
I
think
a
dress
principle
is
a
good
idea
.
The
reason
is
simple
.
School
is
tough
enough
without
worrying
about
looking
cool
every
single
day
.
The
fact
is
,
the
less
I
have
to
decide
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
the
better
.
I
also
would
n't
mind
not
having
to
see
guys
wearing
oversized
jeans
and
shirts
.
And
I
certainly
would
welcome
not
seeing
kids
showing
off
designer
clothes
.
 
Andy
is
surprised
at
my
opinion
.
He
says
he
ca
n't
believe
that
I
would
be
willing
to
give
up
my
all-American
teenage
birthright
by
dressing
like
--
well
,
like
a
typical
teenager
.
Last
night
,
he
even
dragged
out
Mom
and
Dad
's
high
school
photo
albums
.
What
a
couple
of
peace-loving
hippies
they
were
!
 
The
vote
for
or
against
uniforms
took
place
later
that
day
.
The
results
of
the
vote
and
the
headmaster
's
decision
will
be
announced
next
week
.
I
wonder
what
it
will
be
.
I
know
how
I
voted
,
and
I
'm
pretty
sure
I
know
how
Andy
voted
.
 
How
would
you
vote
--
for
or
against
?"	"1

"Each
time
a
city
building
is
set
up
,
the
grass
in
that
spot
and
trees
that
once
reached
up
to
the
sky
are
replaced
by
a
tar
roof
.
In
addition
to
that
,
roads
,
parking
lots
,
and
yet
more
buildings
are
being
constructed
.
The
total
lost
green
space
can
have
a
very
real
effect
on
a
city
's
air
temperature
,
air
quality
and
energy
costs
.
On
a
summer
day
in
most
American
cities
,
a
tar
roof
can
feel
like
the
inside
of
an
oven
.
But
what
if
we
could
replace
the
hot
roof
of
each
skyscraper
or
building
in
a
city
with
grass
or
a
garden
?
 
Whether
it
holds
vegetable
gardens
,
wildflowers
,
or
meadow
grasses
,
a
green
roof
can
lower
the
temperature
above
a
building
by
60
degrees
,
which
can
reduce
the
building
's
energy
costs
.
If
used
more
widely
,
green
roofs
could
decrease
a
city
's
total
energy
costs
,
reduce
polluted
air
from
power
plant
,
and
improve
air
quality
and
public
health
.
But
that
's
not
all
--
green
roofs
are
a
great
way
to
deal
with
water
management
in
urban
areas
with
overwhelmed
sewerage
systems
,
and
actually
extend
the
life
time
of
the
roof
itself
.
And
green
roofs
do
something
else
:
They
beautify
the
city
--
whether
you
're
on
the
3rd
floor
or
the
30th
.
Now
that
's
a
great
achievement
.
 
The
environmental
nonprofit
group
Earth
Pledge
is
promoting
a
Green
Roofs
progamme
.

"I
took
the
bus
to
work
for
many
years
.
No
one
knew
each
other
;
the
passengers
all
sat
there
sleepily
in
the
morning
.
The
bus
was
cheerless
and
silent
.
 
One
of
the
passengers
was
a
small
gray-haired
man
who
took
the
bus
to
the
center
for
senior
citizens
every
morning
.
No
one
ever
paid
very
much
attention
to
him
.
 
One
July
morning
he
said
good
morning
to
the
driver
and
smiled
.
The
driver
nodded
guardedly
.
The
rest
of
us
were
silent
.
 
The
next
day
,
the
old
man
boarded
with
a
big
smile
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
:
""
A
very
good
morning
to
you
all
!
""
Some
of
us
looked
up
,
amazed
,
and
murmured
""
Good
Morning
""
in
reply
.
 
The
following
weeks
,
our
friend
was
dressed
in
a
nice
old
suit
and
tie
.
His
thin
hair
had
been
carefully
combed
.
He
said
good
morning
to
us
every
day
and
we
gradually
began
to
nod
and
talk
to
each
other
.
 
One
morning
he
even
had
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
in
his
hand
.
The
driver
turned
around
smiling
and
asked
:
""
Have
you
got
yourself
a
girlfriend
,
Charlie
?
""
We
never
got
to
know
if
his
name
really
was
""
Charlie
""
,
but
he
nodded
shyly
and
said
yes
.
The
other
passengers
whistled
and
clapped
at
him
.
Charlie
waved
the
flowers
before
he
sat
down
on
his
seat
.
 
Every
morning
after
that
Charlie
always
brought
flowers
.
Some
passengers
also
brought
flowers
for
him
.
The
bus
became
a
happy
place
.
 
Then
,
one
morning
,
as
autumn
was
closing
in
,
Charlie
was
n't
waiting
at
his
usual
stop
.
When
he
was
n't
there
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
,
we
started
wondering
if
he
was
sick
or
--
hopefully
-
on
holiday
somewhere
.
 
When
we
came
nearer
to
the
center
for
senior
citizens
,
one
of
the
passengers
asked
the
driver
to
wait
.
We
all
held
our
breaths
when
he
went
to
the
door
.
 
The
old
gentle
man
was
fine
,
but
one
of
his
close
friends
had
died
over
the
weekend
.
How
silent
we
were
the
rest
of
the
way
to
work
.
 
The
next
Monday
Charlie
was
waiting
at
the
stop
,
stooping
a
bit
more
,
a
little
bit
more
gray
,
and
without
a
tie
.
Inside
the
bus
was
silent
.
Even
though
no
one
had
talked
about
it
,
all
of
us
sat
there
silently
,
our
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
in
our
hands

"""
Have
you
ever
found
a
treasure
?
""
I
once
asked
my
father
.
He
smiled
a
big
smile
and
told
me
this
story
.
 
""
Once
when
I
was
about
ten
years
old
,
""
my
father
told
me
,
""
I
went
treasure
hunting
with
my
older
sister
.
She
had
heard
some
people
talking
about
a
treasure
box
hidden
in
a
hillside
cave
.
One
day
we
went
there
and
spent
two
or
three
hours
looking
for
the
entrance
to
the
cave
.
Then
,
as
I
was
trying
to
squeeze
between
two
big
stones
,
I
suddenly
fell
into
a
hole
.
It
was
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
that
led
to
the
cave
.
My
sister
and
I
crawled
through
into
it
.
It
was
very
dark
but
we
had
brought
a
flashlight
and
we
were
shocked
to
see
that
there
was
a
large
wooden
box
ahead
of
us
.
We
ran
to
the
box
and
pulled
it
open
.
It
was
filled
with
silver
and
gold
coins
.
I
started
to
count
them
but
my
sister
told
me
to
stop
.
""
This
is
only
money
,
""
she
said
,
""
This
is
not
a
real
treasure
.
If
you
want
money
,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
work
for
it
""
.
 
I
was
going
to
argue
with
her
when
I
suddenly
noticed
a
big
metal
box
on
the
other
side
of
the
cave
.
The
box
was
filled
with
statues
.
Some
statues
were
made
of
ivory
or
gold
,
with
diamonds
for
eyes
and
rubies
for
lips
.
I
took
one
of
the
gold
statues
out
of
the
box
.
'Do
n't
do
that
!
'
yelled
my
sister
.
'This
is
only
beauty
and
art
.
It
is
not
a
real
treasure
.
There
must
be
something
better
here
.
'
 
We
searched
and
searched
,
but
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
cave
.
Then
the
battery
in
the
flashlight
started
to
die
.
We
got
scared
and
crawled
back
.
I
wiggled
through
but
my
sister
got
stuck
half
way
between
the
stones
.
I
tried
to
pull
her
out
but
I
could
n't
.
I
ran
up
and
down
the
street
knocking
on
doors
but
nobody
would
come
.
 
The
only
one
who
would
help
was
a
girl
about
my
age
.
She
got
a
rope
and
a
spade
and
a
water
bottle
.
About
an
hour
later
,
we
got
my
sister
out
of
the
stones
.
I
became
good
friends
with
the
girl
who
had
helped
us
.
She
was
very
responsible
,
faithful
,
kind
and
loving
.
When
we
finished
college
I
realized
that
she
was
the
woman
I
wanted
to
marry
.
That
's
your
mom
.
I
thought
I
had
found
the
best
treasure
in
the
world
.

"Most
young
people
enjoy
some
form
of
physical
activity
.
It
may
be
walking
,
cycling
or
swimming
,
or
in
winter
,
skating
or
skiing
.
It
may
be
a
game
of
some
kind
:
football
,
hockey
,
golf
,
or
tennis
.
It
may
be
mountaineering
.
 
Those
who
have
a
passion
for
climbing
high
and
steep
mountains
are
often
looked
upon
with
astonishment
.
Why
are
men
and
women
are
willing
to
suffer
cold
and
hardship
,
and
to
take
risks
on
high
mountains
?
This
astonishment
is
caused
probably
by
the
difference
between
mountaineering
and
other
forms
of
activity
to
which
men
give
their
leisure
.
 
Mountaineering
is
a
sport
,
not
a
game
.
There
are
no
man-made
rules
,
as
there
are
for
such
games
as
tennis
and
football
.
There
are
,
of
course
,
rules
of
a
different
kind
which
it
would
be
dangerous
to
ignore
,
but
it
is
this
freedom
from
man-made
rules
that
makes
mountaineering
attractive
to
many
people
.
Those
who
climb
mountains
are
free
to
use
their
own
methods
.
 
If
we
compare
mountaineering
and
other
more
familiar
sports
,
we
might
think
that
one
big
difference
is
that
mountaineering
is
not
a
""
team
sport
""
.
Then
we
are
mistaken
in
this
.
There
are
,
it
is
true
,
no
""
matches
""
between
""
teams
""
of
climbers
,
but
when
climbers
are
on
a
rock
surface
linked
by
a
rope
on
which
their
lives
may
depend
,
there
is
obviously
teamwork
.
 
A
mountain
climber
knows
that
he
may
have
to
fight
forces
that
are
stronger
and
more
powerful
than
man
.
He
has
to
fight
the
forces
of
nature
.
This
sport
requires
high
mental
and
physical
qualities
.
 
A
mountain
climber
continues
to
improve
his
skills
year
after
year
.
A
skier
is
probably
past
his
best
by
the
age
of
thirty
,
and
most
international
tennis
champions
are
in
their
early
twenties
.
But
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
man
of
fifty
or
sixty
to
climb
the
highest
mountains
in
Alps
.
They
may
take
more
time
than
younger
men
,
but
they
probably
climb
with
more
skills
than
waste
less
effort

little
more
than
804
million
views
at
press
time
.
PSY
made
the
announcement
on
his
Twitter
page
earlier
today
.
 
Since
its
release
,
the
song
has
defeated
such
other
popular
videos
as
Jennifer
Lopez
's
'On
the
Floor
'
and
Eminem
's
'Love
the
Way
You
Lie
'
.
And
in
September
,
'Gangnam
Style
'
also
became
the
most
liked
video
on
YouTube
,
now
with
nearly
5.4
million
thumbs
up
.
 
At
the
time
of
the
announcement
,
the
Guinness
Book
of
World
Records
released
a
statement
saying
:
""
In
years
past
it
was
unthinkable
that
something
would
be
viewed
a
hundred
million
times
,
and
now
Gangnam
Style
has
achieved
more
than
twice
this
figure
in
just
three
months
on
YouTube
.
PSY
,
your
certificate
is
waiting
here
at
our
office
,
come
pick
it
up
any
time
!
""
 
Despite
its
massive
popularity
,
the
video
shows
no
signs
of
slowing
down
,
and
it
even
has
a
shot
at
becoming
the
first
video
to
get
more
than
one
billion
views
.
 
If
it
maintains
its
current
rate
of
around
six
million
new
views
per
day
,
'Gangnam
Style
'
would
be
in
line
to
break
that
record
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
 
The
YouTube
honors
are
just
the
latest
in
a
long
list
that
shows
just
how
popular
the
song
has
become
.
Since
it
was
released
in
July
,
the
song
has
seen
a
meteoric
rise
through
the
music
industry
.
 
It
has
found
its
way
to
the
tops
of
music
charts
in
more
than
30
countries
,
including
the
United
Kingdom
,
Germany
,
France
,
Spain
and
Canada
,
while
providing
material
for
thousands
of
parody
videos
.
 
It
became
part
of
the
2012
presidential
elections
with
the
now
famous
'Mitt
Romney
Style
'
video
and
was
even
used
by
the
North
Korean
government
in
propaganda
films
promoting
their
supreme
leader
.
 
Meanwhile
,
such
influential
figures
as
President
Obama
,
UN
Secretary
General
Ban
Ki-moon
and
Google
Executive
Chairman
Eric
Schmidt
have
all
made
mention
of
the
hit
song

"Life
is
full
of
sweet
surprises
for
Chinese
pop
singer
Edell
.
 
She
majored
in
design
in
a
Canadian
college
.
But
when
she
was
looking
for
a
job
after
graduation
,
she
found
herself
rising
as
a
star
in
singing
.
Then
she
became
a
hostess
on
TV
.
""
These
are
roles
I
never
expected
to
take
,
""
she
said
.
 
Edell
is
open
to
every
possibility
in
life
,
not
afraid
to
try
new
things
.
She
says
that
every
day
she
tries
to
get
herself
ready
to
take
any
chance
that
occurs
in
life
.
 
""
My
mom
told
me
chance
only
rewards
those
with
a
prepared
mind
,
""
she
said
.
""
So
I
've
tried
to
explore
my
potential
talents
.
Thus
I
wo
n't
be
at
a
loss
when
the
right
opportunity
comes
up
.
""
 
Edell
learned
ballet
in
her
childhood
until
she
broke
her
back
in
practice
.
She
then
fell
in
love
with
music
.
 
Like
many
girls
of
her
age
,
she
has
a
rich
collection
of
CDs
.
But
she
never
dreamed
of
being
a
singer
.
One
day
she
was
noticed
by
a
talent
scout
.
she
gave
a
try
and
succeeded
!
And
that
's
not
the
end
of
the
story
.
 
Once
she
was
invited
to
be
the
hostess
of
the
Asian
MTV
Awards
in
Thailand
.
Though
she
has
never
had
any
experience
,
she
accepted
the
invitation
.
""
At
least
I
could
make
a
trip
to
the
foreign
country
,
""
she
said
.
Upon
arrival
at
the
ceremony
,
she
had
to
read
through
a
91-page
English
biography
of
every
guest
.
She
studied
it
so
much
that
she
could
recite
all
the
details
in
it
.
 
It
helped
her
greatly
.
She
greeted
those
strange
faces
she
had
never
seen
before
and
talked
with
them
like
an
old
friend
.
She
did
a
great
job
.
The
MTV
channel
was
so
satisfied
that
they
offered
her
a
job
as
a
TV
hostess
.
""
Try
to
get
yourself
well-prepared
in
life
,
""
she
said
.
""
In
the
meantime
,
try
to
live
your
life
with
brains
.

"A
good
friend
of
mine
was
complaining
about
her
son
the
other
day
.
""
Did
you
notice
,
""
she
started
,
""
how
he
did
n't
wait
for
me
to
get
my
salad
before
he
dove
into
his
?
""
 
True
enough
,
the
boy
attacked
his
plate
faster
than
a
cat
in
the
wild
.
Without
manners
,
we
're
no
more
than
animals
.
Actually
,
that
's
not
true
.
I
've
been
watching
and
feeding
a
group
of
wild
cats
,
and
they
show
unusual
politeness
toward
each
other
.
Even
when
food
is
scarce
,
they
take
turns
,
leaving
at
least
a
small
part
for
the
next
in
line
.
 
My
mother
educated
her
three
children
to
have
good
manners
all
the
time
.
We
were
made
to
feel
very
uncomfortable
as
if
we
were
sitting
on
pins
and
needles
until
we
got
used
to
saying
please
,
thank
you
,
pardon
me
,
and
I
'm
sorry
.
And
I
have
to
say
,
while
it
was
a
painful
learning
experience
,
it
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
.
 
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
often
I
sat
with
my
friends
,
eating
at
their
dinner
tables
,
and
their
parents
thought
highly
of
my
good
manners
.
While
it
was
a
little
embarrassing
,
I
knew
even
then
that
my
mother
's
teachings
were
paying
off
.
 
Many
years
later
,
when
I
was
attending
seminars
across
the
country
,
my
manners
were
quite
useful
.
 
While
I
regret
that
I
have
n't
been
a
perfect
example
,
I
'm
still
working
on
it
.
I
suppose
,
in
this
regard
,
my
mother
lives
on
through
me
.
I
did
n't
have
her
beautiful
singing
voice
or
her
green
eyes
,
but
she
did
make
sure
I
received
one
of
her
finest
characteristics

"Have
you
heard
of
the
scandal
that
happened
in
one
of
Great
Britain
's
biggest
supermarket
chains
called
Tesco
?
The
British
love
Tesco
as
it
sells
very
cheap
products
and
it
can
be
found
on
almost
every
corner
of
a
British
city
or
town
.
 
On
January
15th
2013
food
inspectors
discovered
30
%
horsemeat
in
a
certain
brand
of
frozen
beefburgers
that
were
mostly
sold
by
Tesco
in
the
UK
and
Ireland
.
 
In
times
of
social
media
like
Facebook
and
Twitter
the
news
has
spread
fast
and
customers
have
been
very
concerned
about
what
the
food
they
buy
actually
contains
.
Tesco
said
it
had
taken
away
the
burgers
from
the
shop
shelves
immediately
,
and
apologized
to
their
customers
.
They
also
promised
that
they
would
find
out
what
exactly
happened
and
that
they
would
work
harder
than
ever
so
this
would
never
happen
again
.
Customers
are
also
able
to
return
the
beefburgers
and
get
a
refund
,
that
is
,
their
money
back
.
 
However
,
it
will
be
hard
for
Tesco
to
get
the
people
's
trust
back
.
Just
imagine
buying
lovely
beefburgers
that
you
fry
at
home
and
suddenly
you
find
out
that
you
have
actually
eaten
horsemeat
!
In
this
case
not
only
horse
lovers
will
be
upset
!
 
By
the
way
,
why
are
British
people
so
shocked
about
eating
horsemeat
?
In
history
,
horses
have
played
great
roles
as
working
animals
and
as
an
important
means
of
transport
.
When
Britons
of
today
think
of
horses
,
they
think
of
majestic
animals
or
cute
pets
rather
than
meat
.
 
But
this
is
not
the
only
reason
for
the
protest
:
Customers
also
want
to
be
sure
that
the
products
they
buy
contain
what
it
says
on
the
label
.
Hopefully
,
supermarkets
can
avoid
mistakes
like
that
in
the
future
.
Maybe
there
should
be
stricter
regulations
and
more
controls
of
our
food
?
Otherwise
we
will
soon
find
ourselves
eating
panda
meat
instead
of
pork
and
parrot
instead
of
chicken
.
So
the
next
time
you
are
in
a
supermarket
maybe
check
the
ingredients
of
your
food
before
you
buy
it
or
you
could
get
a
nasty
surprise

"Cheektowage
Central
Middle
School
can
be
a
lot
of
fun
.
It
has
game
nights
and
student
dances
,
after-school
activities
,
and
sports
teams
.
However
,
students
at
the
school
must
earn
the
right
to
join
in
the
fun
.
If
they
do
n't
do
their
homework
,
participate
in
class
,
and
behave
at
all
times
,
they
're
banned
from
participating
in
after-school
activities
.
 
Students
and
parents
say
the
threat
of
being
excluded
appears
to
be
working
.
Kenny
T.
of
Reno
,
Nev.
,
says
it
taught
him
that
actions
have
consequences
:
""
I
learned
that
I
need
to
be
balanced
in
both
my
work
and
athletics
to
be
rewarded
for
working
hard
.
""
Parent
Sondra
LaMacchia
told
The
New
York
Times
that
her
14-year-old
daughter
is
learning
responsibility
at
Cheektowaga
Central
.
The
teen
used
to
perform
poorly
in
her
studies
,
but
then
she
was
banned
from
a
school
dance
.
The
message
got
through
loud
and
clear
.
""
It
's
nobody
's
fault
but
hers
,
""
LaMacchia
said
.
 
Although
exclusion
may
help
teach
responsibility
,
some
psychologists
say
it
can
also
be
threatening
,
especially
for
students
who
often
cause
,
or
may
cause
,
trouble
in
school
.
They
might
become
more
aggressive
and
antisocial
,
which
is
exactly
what
schools
like
Cheektowaga
Central
want
to
prevent
.
 
Should
schools
exclude
students
from
activities
to
get
them
to
behave
?
I
believe
teens
need
school
activities
and
that
inclusion
can
be
the
answer
.
For
some
troubled
students
,
activities
can
be
their
motivation
to
stay
in
school
.
""
Activities
such
as
sports
may
be
the
only
thing
keeping
certain
students
in
school
,
""
says
Duace
Wood
,
a
teacher
at
Mohonasen
High
School
in
Rotterdam
,
N.Y.
Getting
involved
in
after-class
activities
keeps
troublesome
students
in
class
.
Even
if
they
do
n't
do
as
well
as
their
classmates
,
they
are
still
learning
.
The
more
time
they
spend
at
school
,
the
less
time
they
have
to
even
think
about
starting
trouble
.
Teams
also
provide
support
and
role
models
,
and
they
help
build
the
confidence
that
students
need
to
succeed
.
If
students
who
do
n't
behave
are
banned
from
activities
,
they
might
give
up
on
school
altogether

"This
year
,
""
Wild
China
""
is
famous
,
it
shows
us
the
beautiful
scenes
.
But
in
fact
,
the
environment
around
us
is
getting
worse
and
worse
.
In
some
places
,
we
ca
n't
see
fish
swimming
in
the
river
or
trees
on
the
mountains
.
Many
animals
are
facing
the
danger
of
living
.
At
the
same
time
,
man
is
killing
animals
just
for
getting
their
skin
and
meat
.
In
our
country
,
the
number
of
wild
animals
is
becoming
smaller
and
smaller
.
Some
of
them
are
even
dying
out
.
 
It
's
time
to
protect
our
environment
.
But
what
can
we
do
?
How
to
protect
it
?
For
example
,
we
can
go
to
school
on
foot
or
by
bike
.
we
can
use
shopping
baskets
not
plastic
bags
when
we
go
shopping
,
and
we
can
use
both
sides
of
the
paper
to
write
.
Also
,
we
should
plant
more
trees
to
protect
the
animals
'
living
.
 
In
a
word
,
if
everyone
does
more
to
our
environment
,
our
life
will
be
better
.
""
There
is
only
one
earth
""
,
I
hope
everyone
will
protect
our
environment
well

"Earlier
this
year
,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
proposed
a
stricter
nationwide
health
standard
for
smog-causing
pollutants
that
would
bring
substantial
benefits
to
millions
of
Americans
.
With
a
final
rule
expected
by
the
end
of
this
month
,
some
opponents
,
mainly
from
industrial
and
oil-producing
states
,
are
pushing
back
.
They
say
investments
required
to
produce
cleaner
air
are
too
expensive
and
not
scientifically
justified
.
 
Lisa
Jackson
,
the
E.P.A
.
administrator
,
needs
to
stick
to
her
guns
.
This
is
only
the
first
of
several
political
tests
to
come
this
fall
,
as
she
also
seeks
to
tighten
rules
governing
individual
pollutants
like
mercury
and
global
warming
gases
like
carbon
dioxide
.
 
The
health
standard
she
is
proposing
covers
ground-level
ozone
,
commonly
known
as
smog
,
which
is
formed
when
sunlight
mixes
with
pollutants
from
factories
,
refineries
,
power
plants
and
automobiles
.
Ozone
is
a
major
health
threat
,
contributing
to
heart
disease
and
various
respiratory
problems
.
 
Ms.
Jackson
's
proposal
--
to
reduce
the
permitted
level
of
smog
in
the
air
from
the
current
75
parts
per
billion
to
between
60
parts
per
billion
and
70
parts
per
billion
--
is
sensible
,
no
matter
what
industry
's
defenders
may
claim
.
It
had
been
recommended
by
the
agency
's
independent
scientific
panel
but
rejected
by
the
Bush
administration
,
which
proposed
a
weaker
standard
.
 
Industry
will
have
to
make
investments
in
cleaner
power
plants
,
and
new
technologies
may
be
required
.
As
it
is
,
about
half
the
counties
that
monitor
ozone
levels
are
not
yet
in
compliance
with
current
standards
,
let
alone
the
proposed
standard
.
 
Fears
about
burdening
industry
raised
by
critics
like
George
Voinovich
,
a
Republican
of
Ohio
,
and
Mary
Landrieu
,
a
Democrat
of
Louisiana
,
can
not
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
,
especially
in
the
middle
of
a
recession
.
But
the
health
benefits
,
E.P.A
.
says
,
far
outweigh
the
costs
,
and
the
time
frame
for
compliance
is
generous

"Have
you
thought
about
what
determines
the
way
we
are
as
we
grow
up
?
Remember
the
TV
program
Seven
Up
?
It
started
following
the
lives
of
a
group
of
children
in
1963
.
We
first
meet
them
as
wide-eyed
seven-year-olds
and
then
catch
up
with
them
at
seven-year
intervals
:
nervous
14-year-olds
,
serious
21-year-olds
,
then
grown-ups
.
 
Some
of
the
stories
are
inspiring
,
others
sad
,
but
what
is
interesting
in
almost
all
the
cases
is
the
way
in
which
the
children
's
early
hopes
and
dreams
are
shown
in
their
future
lives
,
for
example
,
at
seven
,
Tony
is
a
lively
child
who
says
he
wants
to
become
a
sportsman
or
a
taxi
driver
.
When
he
grows
up
,
he
goes
on
to
do
both
.
How
about
Nicki
,
who
says
,
""
I
'd
like
to
find
out
about
the
moon
.
""
and
goes
on
to
become
a
space
scientist
.
As
a
child
,
soft
-
spoken
Bruce
says
he
wants
to
help
""
poor
children
""
and
ends
up
teaching
in
India
.
 
But
if
the
lives
of
all
the
children
had
followed
this
pattern
,
the
program
would
be
far
less
interesting
than
it
actually
was
.
It
was
the
children
whose
childhood
did
not
prepare
them
for
what
was
to
come
that
made
the
program
so
inspiring
.
Where
did
their
ideas
come
from
about
what
they
wanted
to
do
when
they
grew
up
?
Are
children
influenced
by
what
their
parents
do
,
by
what
they
see
on
television
,
or
by
what
their
teachers
say
?
How
great
is
the
effect
of
a
single
important
event
?
Many
film
directors
,
including
Stephen
Spielberg
,
say
that
an
early
visit
to
the
cinema
was
the
turning
point
in
their
lives
.
Dr.
Magaret
Mc
Allister
,
who
has
done
a
lot
of
research
in
this
area
,
thinks
that
the
major
influences
are
parents
,
friends
and
the
wider
society

9:00
am
already
!
Richard
had
to
leave
for
work
!
Before
leaving
he
hurriedly
looked
at
the
newspaper
and
stood
still
!
Is
he
seeing
it
right
?
He
rubbed
his
eyes
and
saw
again
...
Yes
,
it
was
his
name
in
the
obituary
!
He
threw
the
paper
in
the
bin
and
screamed
.
 
Richard
started
to
recollect
.
He
remembered
that
last
night
when
he
went
to
bed
he
had
a
chest
pain
and
he
was
rushed
to
hospital
.
Then
he
went
into
a
sound
sleep
.
But
what
happened
after
that
?
 
He
could
suddenly
see
his
living
room
filled
with
people
...
all
in
tears
;
his
mom
,
his
wife
and
his
children
.
He
also
saw
his
best
friend
,
the
one
he
had
a
serious
misunderstanding
a
few
days
back
.
He
wanted
to
say
""
Sorry
""
to
him
...
but
now
no
one
could
hear
his
voice
.
 
He
wondered
how
he
could
tell
his
mom
that
he
felt
so
thankful
to
have
her
in
his
life
!
He
wanted
to
tell
his
children
how
much
he
loved
them
.
He
wanted
to
tell
his
wife
how
much
he
loved
her
;
he
felt
sorry
to
have
hurt
her
sometimes
.
 
Richard
started
crying
and
pleading
to
God
for
one
LAST
chance
!
""
God
,
one
last
chance
,
please
""
,
shouted
Richard
and
opened
his
eyes
.
 
Oh
,
this
was
a
dream
!
 
He
woke
up
;
looked
around
everywhere
.
He
was
on
his
bed
;
his
wife
lay
beside
him
,
deep
in
sleep
.
Richard
whispered
in
her
ears
,
""
You
are
the
best
thing
to
have
ever
happened
to
me
!
""
 
He
went
up
to
the
window
,
looking
outside
.
Yes
,
everything
was
just
the
way
he
has
been
knowing
so
long
.
He
decided
to
meet
up
his
friends
and
clear
all
misunderstandings
;
he
also
decided
to
tell
everyone
who
mattered
to
him
all
that
has
remained
unsaid
so
far

So
she
went

Hearing

the

"""
Wake
up
.
Alicia
is
waiting
for
you
outside
,
""
my
mother
called
from
the
kitchen
.
My
mother
did
n't
like
me
going
for
this
weekend
to
my
friend
's
house
in
the
mountains
.
""
I
trust
you
,
but
I
do
n't
trust
the
people
out
there
,
""
she
said
seriously
.
""
I
'm
going
to
be
fine
,
""
were
my
last
words
before
closing
the
door
of
the
Jeep
.
The
vehicle
went
along
the
dusty
road
and
my
mother
grew
smaller
in
the
distance
.
 
The
trip
over
the
rough
road
was
uncomfortable
.
It
was
scary
to
climb
the
steep
hills
surrounded
by
great
pines
.
After
a
long
trip
we
finally
arrived
at
the
house
.
From
the
moment
I
got
there
I
knew
I
would
forever
love
the
house
.
It
was
decorated
like
an
old
country
home
.
My
room
was
small
,
yet
set
up
nicely
.
That
night
I
went
to
sleep
early
,
not
because
I
did
n't
want
to
continue
my
search
,
but
because
I
was
tired
after
the
long
trip
.
 
In
the
morning
,
the
singing
of
the
birds
woke
me
up
.
The
light
was
just
getting
through
the
window
.
A
strong
smell
of
baking
and
fresh
coffee
came
from
the
kitchen
.
I
wandered
around
looking
for
a
living
soul
,
but
the
house
was
empty
.
I
had
the
whole
day
to
myself
;
my
friend
had
gone
hiking
.
I
did
n't
want
to
go
with
her
.
The
main
reason
for
this
trip
was
to
spend
some
time
alone
to
think
about
the
events
happening
in
my
life
.
 
After
an
icy
shower
,
my
energies
were
at
their
fullest
.
With
basket
in
hand
,
I
started
my
hunt
.
I
did
not
mind
walking
alone
;
it
was
a
wonderful
feeling
to
be
in
contact
with
nature
for
the
first
time
.
The
sound
of
the
water
running
through
the
rocks
gave
me
great
peace
.
I
never
felt
such
independence
in
my
soul
before

"Mr.
Evans
lives
in
a
city
.
He
was
a
math
teacher
three
years
ago
.
He
taught
well
and
his
students
liked
him
.
So
he
decided
to
work
in
the
middle
school
all
his
life
.
But
a
terrible
accident
changed
his
fortune
.
 
One
spring
he
took
his
class
to
visit
a
place
of
interest
.
The
children
saw
a
lot
of
interesting
things
and
had
a
good
time
there
.
But
on
their
way
to
school
,
their
bus
was
hit
by
a
truck
because
the
young
driver
was
drunk
.
Five
students
died
and
more
than
half
of
the
children
were
injured
in
the
accident
.
He
did
n't
know
how
it
had
happened
and
was
very
sad
about
it
and
after
he
came
out
of
hospital
,
he
left
the
school
and
became
a
policeman
.
He
tried
his
best
to
stop
the
drivers
from
breaking
the
traffic
regulations
.
He
worked
hard
and
was
strict
with
the
drivers
.
So
they
were
afraid
of
him
.
 
One
afternoon
it
was
very
hot
.
Mr.
Evans
was
on
duty
.
He
was
standing
at
the
crossing
and
watching
the
traffic
.
Suddenly
he
saw
a
car
rushing
towards
the
crossing
.
It
ran
so
fast
that
it
almost
hit
a
man
on
a
bike
.
He
stopped
it
at
once
and
saw
a
girl
in
it
.
 
""
Show
your
license
to
me
,
madam
,
""
said
Mr.
Evans
.
 
The
girl
handed
her
bag
to
him
and
said
:
""
Please
look
for
it
in
it
.
I
ca
n't
see
anything
without
glasses
.

"There
are
many

ants
in

One
kind
is
very
strong

People
are
afraid

These
ants
move
in
a
large
group

They
eat
all

animals
on

They
can
kill
and
eat
elephants
,
and
they
can
eat
wood

Sometimes
even
people
are
killed
by
them
.
When
the
ants
come
,
people
leave

But
people

sometimes

"Paris
is
a
very
beautiful
city
but
l
will
not
call
it
the
most
romantic
city
at
all
!
It
is
difficult
to
find
a
hotel
!
That
is
quite
funny
.
Some
policemen
help
us
and
then
we
find
a
hotel
!
The
hotel
is
on
the
sixth
floor
and
it
is
tired
to
climb
up
the
stairs
!
The
room
is
very
simple
but
it
has
a
big
bathroom
.
We
go
out
for
a
walk
to
visit
the
city
.
The
Louvre
Museum
is
our
favourite
one
.
There
are
some
wonderful
pieces
of
art
there
.
The
Eiffel
Tower
looks
so
cool
from
a
far
place
,
but
when
we
get
close
to
it
,
it
does
n't
look
so
good
.
We
also
do
n't
feel
well
about
the
expensive
food
.
Most
of
the
time
,
we
enjoy
Paris
,
but
the
weather
is
not
always
good
.
It
often
rains
.
We
feel
a
little
difficult
because
not
many
people
can
speak
English
and
we
ca
n't
speak
French
.
But
I
'm
still
glad
that
this
is
the
beginning
of
our
travel

interest
in
everything
.
He
had
few
customers
and
did
not
make
them
feel
welcome
,
Bernie
wandered
about
the
store
,
dusting
a
bit
and
sweeping
the
floor
.
His
inventory
remained
almost
the
same
,
as
nothing
much
was
sold
.
A
deep
depressing
set
in
.
He
had
lost
Marie
,
his
true
love
,
and
now
his
business
seemed
lost
as
well
,
Why
did
he
want
to
live
?
 
A
few
houses
down
the
street
lived
a
family
who
had
also
fallen
on
hard
times
.
They
seldom
had
three
meals
a
day
.
Julie
,
the
youngest
girl
,
was
fourteen
.
Julie
worried
about
Mr.
Mears
'
getting
so
thin
.
At
meal
time
,
she
would
take
a
portion
of
their
meal
to
Bernie
.
She
would
stay
and
talk
to
him
,
dusting
and
cleaning
.
 
After
several
months
Bernie
began
to
improve
.
He
still
had
no
customers
to
speak
of
,
but
from
what
he
had
left
in
the
stor
,
he
would
sack
a
few
cans
to
take
to
Julie
's
family
.
 
In
early
spring
,
Julie
saw
her
father
planting
a
garden
.
This
gave
her
an
idea
.
She
suggested
Bernie
making
a
garden
in
the
big
space
beside
the
store
,
which
they
had
once
thought
would
become
a
parking
lot
,
and
sell
the
produce
really
cheap
in
the
store
.
It
would
help
the
neighbors
and
also
Bernie
to
have
money
for
new
merchandise
.
They
would
plant
half
the
garden
space
now
and
half
in
three
weeks
giving
them
fresh
produce
for
a
long
time
.
 
Julie
prayed
hard
as
they
placed
the
seeds
in
the
ground
.
When
the
seeds
sprouted
,
Julie
looked
anxiously
at
the
rows
and
there
were
no
empty
spots
.
They
all
came
up
and
produced
the
best
crop
of
vegetables
Bernie
had
ever
seen
.
They
soon
became
well-known
in
the
community
for
having
the
best
prices
and
finest
produce
in
town
.
They
also
extended
credit
to
their
neighbors
and
accepted
various
items
as
trade
for
merchandise
.
 
The
two
of
them
worked
hard
throughout
the
1930s
and
made
a
very
successful
business
.
Julie
earned
a
salary
.
As
the
economy
picked
up
,
so
did
sales
at
the
store

"Well-known
as
gourmets
,
the
French
spend
more
time
sleeping
and
eating
than
anyone
else
among
the
world
's
rich
nations
,
according
to
a
study
published
on
Monday
.
 
The
average
French
person
sleeps
almost
9
hours
every
night
,
more
than
an
hour
longer
than
Japanese
and
Korean
,
who
sleep
the
least
in
a
survey
of
18
members
of
the
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
(
OECD
)
.
Despite
their
siesta
habit
,
Spanish
rank
only
third
after
Americans
,
who
sleep
more
than
8.5
hours
.
And
while
more
and
more
French
people
prefer
fast-food
chains
these
days
or
wolf
down
a
sandwich
at
their
desk
,
they
still
spend
more
than
two
hour
's
a
day
eating
.
 
That
means
their
meals
are
twice
as
long
as
those
of
the
average
Mexican

who
spends
just
an
hour
a
day
on

The
Japanese
manage
to
spend
close
to
2
hours
a
day
eating
and
drinking
,
placing
them
third
behind
New

.
 
Despite
the
limited
time
,
Americans
spend
eating
each
day
--
-about
an
hour
and
a
quarter
--
-U.S.obesity
rates
are
the
highest
in
the
30
members
of

.
The
Japanese
like
to
spend
their
rare
free
time
watching
TV
or
listening
to
the
radio
.
This
takes
up
47
percent
of

Norwegians
spend
the
most
time
at
leisure
,
just
over
a
quarter
of

day
,
while

low
end
,

spend
just
16

"The
southwest
of
Australia
has
been
named
as
one
of
25
""
hot
spots
""
for
future
species
extinction
because
of
global
warming
.
A
new
study
says
global
warming
will
become
a
top
cause
of
extinction
across
the
world
,
with
thousands
of
species
of
plantsand
animals
likely
to
be
wiped
out
in
the
coming
decades
.
 
According
to
the
study
,
global
warming
ranks
among
the
most
serious
threats
to
the
planet
's
biodiversity
and
,
under
some
conditions
,
may
be
more
than
that
due
to
deforestation
.
This
study
provides
even
stronger
scientific
evidence
that
global
warming
will
result
in
catastrophic
species
losses
across
the
planet
.
Last
month
,
a
UN
study
said
humans
were
responsible
for
the
worst
extinction
and
urged
extra
efforts
to
reach
a
UN
target
of
slowing
the
rate
of
losses
by
2010
.
 
Scientists
disagree
about
how
far
global
warming
is
to
blame
compared
with
other
human
threats
such
as
deforestation
,
pollution
and
the
introduction
of
some
species
to
new
habitats
.
But
the
new
study
looks
at
the
25
""
hot
spots
""
--
areas
that
contain
a
big
concentration
of
plants
and
animals
--
and
predicts
that
11.6
percent
of
all
species
,
with
a
range
from
1
to
43
percent
,
could
be
driven
to
extinction
if
levels
of
heat
trapping
gases
in
the
atmosphere
were
to
keep
rising
in
the
next
100
years
.
 
The
range
would
mean
the
loss
of
thousands
of
species
.
The
study
gave
a
wide
range
because
of
uncertainties
,
for
instance
,
about
the
ability
of
animals
or
plants
to
move
towards
the
poles
if
the
climate
warmed
.
Rare
plants
,
tortoises
or
birds
found
only
on
the
southern
tip
of
Africa
can
not
move
south
because
the
nearest
land
is
thousands
of
miles
away
in
Antarctica

"For
the
first
time
in
Hong
Kong
's
history
,
an
entertainer
has
been
written
into
middle
school
textbooks
.
He
is
considered
one
of
the
best
actors
in
Hong
Kong
.
Yes
,
he
is
Chow
Yun-fat
.
 
The
example
of
his
long
hard
struggle
for
success
has
been
used
in
a
chapter
in
a
Hong
Kong
middle
school
textbook
.
Using
his
experience
,
students
can
learn
to
make
the
most
of
their
time
and
to
grab
every
opportunity
to
succeed
.
 
On
hearing
about
this
,
Chow
said
happily
,
""
I
really
hope
that
my
experiences
can
make
young
people
understand
that
one
should
not
be
afraid
of
difficulties
and
setbacks
,
for
they
are
the
only
way
to
success
.
""
 
Indeed
,
Chow
has
travelled
a
long
and
difficult
path
to
reach
his
success
.
In
1955
,
he
was
born
into
a
poor
family
in
Hong
Kong
.
When
he
was
17
,
he
had
to
leave
school
.
He
worked
in
a
number
of
jobs
--
as
a
postman
,
camera
salesman
and
taxi
driver
.
These
experiences
paved
the
way
for
him
to
play
all
kinds
of
roles
later
in
life
.
 
Chow
broke
into
the
film
industry
in
the
late
1970s
.
He
was
one
of
the
hardest
working
actors
and
starred
in
a
number
of
popular
TV
dramas
and
films
including
""
Shanghai
Bund
""
(
<
<
>
>
)
and
""
A
Better
Tomorrow
""
.
Since
1985
,
he
has
won
many
awards
including
Taiwan
's
Golden
Horse
Awards
and
Hong
Kong
Film
Awards
.
 
In
1995
,
he
went
to
Hollywood
.
Although
he
was
already
over
40
,
he
had
to
learn
English
.
He
even
put
chopsticks
in
his
mouth
to
practise
pronouncing
certain
sounds
His
film
,
""
Crouching
Tiger
,
Hidden
Dragon
""
,
began
to
gain
him
more
fame
and
recognition
around
the
world
.
In
1998
,
the
mayor
of
Chicago
set
aside
January
12
as
""
Chow
Yun-fat
Day

"Thousands
of
people
began
pouring
into
Pennsylvania
from
other
states
.
They
wanted
to
buy
lottery
tickets
.
The
tickets
cost
only
$
0.9
each
.
But
that
small
spending
could
bring
them
a
reward
of
$
90
million
.
That
was
the
second
largest
lottery
jackpot
in
history
.
 
More
than
87
million
tickets
were
bought
for
the
Pennsylvania
lottery
drawing
.
Those
who
bought
tickets
had
to
choose
seven
numbers
from
1
to
80
.
The
chance
of
winning
was
one
in
9.6
million
.
But
that
little
chance
certainly
did
n't
affect
ticket
sales
.
In
the
last
few
days
before
the
drawing
,
tickets
were
selling
at
the
unbelievable
rate
of
500
per
second
.
 
Experts
say
many
people
buy
lottery
tickets
because
they
just
want
to
have
a
piece
of
the
action
.
Others
say
the
lottery
is
a
stock
market
for
poor
people
.
It
allows
them
to
dream
about
wealth
they
'll
probably
never
have
.
 
But
many
people
believe
lotteries
are
no
better
than
legalized
gambling
.
Some
critics
note
that
most
people
who
play
are
poor
and
may
not
be
able
to
afford
the
tickets
.
There
are
also
many
addicts
who
take
the
game
seriously
.
They
may
pour
their
life
savings
into
lottery
tickets
.
Some
clubs
have
been
formed
to
help
them
kick
the
habit
.
 
Politicians
like
lotteries
because
they
provide
money
that
would
otherwise
have
to
come
from
new
taxes
.
The
profits
from
lotteries
are
usually
used
to
pay
for
education
or
programs
for
senior
citizens
.
But
critics
say
this
arrangement
just
allows
states
to
legalize
vice
,
under
the
name
of
social
progress
.
 
No
matter
whether
you
regard
state
lotteries
right
or
not
,
you
can
not
refuse
to
accept
their
extreme
popularity
with
many
Americans

"Oliver
Twist
was
born
in
a
workhouse
,
and
when
he
arrived
in
this
hard
world
,
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
he
would
live
beyond
the
first
three
minutes
.
He
lay
on
a
hard
little
bed
and
struggled
to
start
breathing
.
 
Oliver
fought
his
first
battle
without
much
assistance
from
the
two
people
present
at
his
birth
.
One
was
an
old
woman
,
who
was
nearly
always
drunk
,
and
the
other
was
a
busy
local
doctor
,
who
was
not
paid
enough
to
be
very
interested
in
Oliver
's
survival
.
After
all，death
was
a
common
event
in
the
workhouse，where
only
the
poor
and
homeless
lived．
 
However
,
Oliver
managed
to
draw
his
first
breath
,
and
then
announced
his
arrival
to
the
rest
of
the
workhouse
by
crying
loudly
.
His
mother
raised
her
pale
young
face
from
the
pillow
and
whispered
,
""
Let
me
see
the
child
,
and
die
.
""
 
The
doctor
turned
away
from
the
fire
,
where
he
had
been
warming
his
hands
.
""
You
must
not
talk
about
dying
yet
,
""
he
said
to
her
kindly
.
He
gave
her
the
child
to
hold
.
Lovingly
,
she
kissed
the
baby
on
its
forehead
with
her
cold
white
lips
,
then
stared
wildly
around
the
room
,
fell
back
--
and
died
.
""
Poor
dear
!
""
said
the
nurse
,
hurriedly
putting
a
green
glass
bottle
back
in
the
pocket
of
her
long
skirt
.
 
The
doctor
began
to
put
on
his
coat
.
""
The
baby
is
weak
and
will
probably
have
difficulties
,
""
he
said
.
""
If
so
,
give
it
a
little
milk
to
keep
it
quiet
.
""
Then
he
looked
at
the
dead
woman
.
""
The
mother
was
a
good-looking
girl
.
Where
did
she
come
from
?
""
 
""
She
was
brought
here
last
night
,
""
replied
the
old
woman
.
""
She
was
found
lying
in
the
street
.
She
'd
walked
some
distance
,
judging
by
her
shoes
,
which
were
worn
to
pieces
.
Where
she
came
from
,
where
she
was
going
to
,
or
what
her
name
was
,
nobody
knows
.
""
 
The
doctor
lifted
the
girl
's
left
hand
.
""
The
old
story
,
""
he
said
sadly
,
shaking
his
head
.
""
No
wedding
ring
,
I
see
.
Ah
!
Good
night
.
""
 
And
so
Oliver
was
left
with
only
the
drunken
nurse
.
Without
clothes
,
under
his
first
blanket
,
he
could
have
been
the
child
of
a
king
or
a
beggar
.
But
when
the
woman
dressed
him
later
in
rough
cotton
clothes
,
yellow
with
age
,
he
looked
exactly
what
he
was
--
an
orphan
in
a
workhouse
,
ready
for
a
life
of
misery
,
hunger
,
and
neglect
.
 
Oliver
cried
loudly
.
If
he
could
have
known
that
he
was
a
workhouse
orphan
,
perhaps
he
would
have
cried
even
more
loudly
.
 
There
was
no
one
to
look
after
the
baby
in
the
workhouse
,
so
Oliver
was
sent
to
a
special
""
baby
farm
""
nearby
.
There
,
he
and
thirty
other
children
rolled
around
the
floor
all
day
,
without
the
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
.
Mrs
Mann
,
the
old
woman
who
""
looked
after
""
them
,
was
very
experienced
.
She
knew
what
was
good
for
children
,
and
a
full
stomach
was
very
dangerous
to
their
health
.
She
also
knew
what
was
good
for
herself
,
so
she
kept
for
her
own
use
the
money
that
she
was
given
for
the
children
's
food
.
The
board
responsible
for
the
orphans
sometimes
checked
on
the
health
of
the
children
,
but
they
always
sent
the
beadle
,
a
kind
of
local
policeman
,
to
announce
their
visit
the
day
before
.
So
whenever
the
board
arrived
,
of
course
,
the
children
were
always
neat
and
clean
.
 
This
was
the
way
Oliver
was
brought
up
.
Consequently
,
at
the
age
of
nine
he
was
a
pale
,
thin
child
and
short
for
his
age
.
But
despite
frequent
beatings
by
Mrs
Mann
,
his
spirit
was
strong
,
which
was
probably
the
reason
why
he
managed
to
reach
the
age
of
nine
at
all
.
 
On
Oliver
's
ninth
birthday
,
Mr
Bumble
,
the
beadle
,
came
to
the
house
to
see
Mrs
Mann
.
Through
the
front
window
Mrs
Mann
saw
him
at
the
gate
,
and
turned
quickly
to
the
girl
who
worked
with
her
.
 
""
Quick
!
Take
Oliver
and
those
others
upstairs
to
be
washed
!
""
she
said
.
Then
she
ran
out
to
unlock
the
gate
which
was
always
kept
locked
."	"1

"If
I
were
writing
a
history
of
my
family
,
some
of
the
darkest
moments
recorded
would
be
those
surrounding
Christmas
trees
.
One
would
certainly
think
otherwise
;
selecting
and
putting
up
our
trees
have
always
been
filled
with
risk
.
 
For
example
,
one
afternoon
dangerously
close
to
Christmas
Eve
my
mother
bought
what
she
thought
to
be
a
bargain
,
a
glorious
tree
that
was
so
full
and
tall
that
we
could
hardly
get
it
into
the
house
.
Once
we
did
,
my
father
immediately
realized
that
we
would
have
to
hire
a
carpenter
to
build
a
stand
for
it
.
 
Another
December
,
perhaps
the
very
next
one
,
we
bought
a
tree
earlier
than
we
ever
had
before
.
We
were
happy
with
its
shape
and
delighted
that
its
size
was
manageable
.
We
easily
placed
it
in
a
stand
,
decorated
it
from
top
to
bottom
,
and
then
self-satisfiedly
sat
back
by
the
fire
in
its
soft
light
.
 
Two
or
three
days
passed
and
the
truth
could
not
be
hidden
;
we
had
bought
a
tree
cut
so
long
ago
that
its
needles
were
coming
off
.
There
was
nothing
to
do
but
undecorated
it
,
take
it
down
,
and
begin
tree
shopping
again
.
 
Our
most
recent
Christmas
tree
offered
still
another
difficult
task
.
When
we
brought
it
home
,
once
again
it
seemed
larger
than
it
was
in
the
great
outdoors
.
To
complicate
matters
,
we
had
bought
a
new
stand
,
one
whose
nuts
and
bolts
worked
more
mysteriously
than
those
of
our
old
stands
.
I
persuaded
two
young
neighbors
to
stop
playing
basketball
and
to
help
us
get
the
tree
into
the
house
and
set
it
correctly
in
the
stand
.
Unfortunately
,
no
one
noticed
the
mud
on
our
helpers
'
shoes
,
so
only
after
removing
several
reddish
brown
sports
from
the
carpet
were
we
able
to
discuss
the
question
of
where
the
lights
and
ornaments
were
stored
.
Perhaps
those
who
cut
their
own
trees
have
tales
more
painful
than
these
.
I
do
n't
care
to
hear
them
,
as
my
family
's
experiences
are
enough
to
cause
me
to
make
the
following
suggestion
:
""
Let
's
forget
the
tree
next
Christmas
.
Let
's
simply
hang
some
flowers
on
the
front
door
and
over
the
mirror
in
the
hall
.

"Many
kids
do
n't
drink
enough
water
daily
,
according
to
a
new
study
.
The
study
's
lead
author
,
Erica
Kenney
,
at
first
planned
to
look
into
the
amount
of
sugary
drinks
kids
were
drinking
in
schools
.
However
,
during
her
research
she
found
that
many
kids
were
simply
not
drinking
enough
water
.
 
Kenney
and
her
team
examined
data
from
a
group
of
4,000
children
,
aged
6
to19
,
between
the
years
of
2009
and
2012
.
The
data
was
taken
from
the
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Survey
,
a
study
on
the
health
of
children
in
the
United
States
conducted
each
year
by
the
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention..
 
While
looking
through
the
survey
results
,
she
noticed
that
more
than
half
of
the
kids
who
took
part
in
the
study
were
dehydrated
.
Of
'
that
group
,
boys
were
76
%
more
likely
than
girls
not
to
have
enough
water
in
their
system
.
Nearly
one
quarter
of
the
kids
in
the
survey
reported
drinking
no
plain
water
at
all
.
 
""
These
findings
highlight
a
possible
health
issue
that
was
n't
given
a
lot
of
attention
in
the
past
,
""
Kenney
said
in
a
statement
.
""
Even
though
for
most
of
these
kids
this
is
not
an
immediate
and
great
health
threat
,
this
is
an
issue
that
could
really
be
reducing
quality
of
life
and
well-being
for
many
children
and
youth
.
""
 
The
United
States-National
Agriculture
Library
says
average
kids
need
between
10
to
14
cups
of
water
every
day
.
This
water
can
come
from
a
mix
of
drinks
and
foods
that
contain
high
amounts
of
water
,
such
as
celery
,
melons
or
tomatoes
.
It
is
also
recommended
that
fluids
come
from
water
instead
of
sugary
drinks
that
are
high
in
calories
and
can
lead
to
weight
problems

"Every
language
has
its
own
special
words
and
expressions
.
And
a
story
can
be
told
about
each
of
them
.
""
Hot
""
is
a
simple
,
easily-understood
word
.
So
are
most
of
the
expressions
made
with
the
word
""
hot
""
.
But
not
always
,
as
we
shall
see
.
 
Take
the
phrase
""
hot
potato
""
for
example
.
The
potato
is
a
popular
vegetable
in
the
United
States
.
Many
people
like
baked
potatoes
,
cooked
in
an
oven
or
fire
.
Imagine
trying
to
carry
a
hot
,
baked
potato
in
your
hand
.
It
would
be
difficult
,
even
painful
,
to
do
so
.
One
such
hot
potato
is
taxes
.
Calling
for
higher
taxes
can
mean
defeat
for
a
politician
.
And
yet
,
if
taxes
are
not
raised
,
some
very
popular
government
programs
could
be
cut
,
which
can
also
make
a
politician
very
unpopular
.
 
Another
expression
is
""
not
so
hot
""
.
If
you
ask
someone
how
she
feels
,
she
may
answer
:
""
Not
so
hot
.
""
What
she
means
is
that
she
does
not
feel
well
.
""
Not
so
hot
""
is
also
a
way
of
saying
that
you
do
not
really
like
something
.
 
""
A
hot
shot
""
is
a
person
,
often
a
young
person
,
who
thinks
he
can
do
anything
.
At
least
he
wants
to
try
.
He
is
very
sure
he
can
succeed
.
But
often
he
fails
.
The
expression
came
from
the
army
.
A
hot
shot
was
a
soldier
who
fired
without
aiming
carefully
.
 
A
person
who
becomes
angry
easily
is
called
""
a
hothead
""
.
An
angry
person
's
neck
often
becomes
red
.
We
say
he
is
""
hot
under
the
collar
""
.
You
could
say
that
your
friend
is
no
hothead
.
But
he
got
hot
under
the
collar
when
someone
took
his
radio
.
 
The
hot
line
was
a
direct
communication
link
between
the
leaders
of
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
United
States
.
The
hot
line
had
an
important
purpose
:
to
prevent
accidental
war
between
the
two
competitors
during
the
period
known
as
the
Cold
War
.
The
American
president
and
the
Soviet
leader
were
able
to
communicate
directly
and
immediately
on
the
hot
line

"Knowing
that
Mrs.
Mallard
suffered
from
a
heart
trouble
,
great
care
was
taken
to
break
to
her
as
gently
as
possible
the
news
of
her
husband
's
death
.
 
It
was
her
sister
Josephine
who
told
her
,
in
broken
sentences
.
Her
husband
's
friend
Richards
was
there
,
too
.
It
was
he
who
had
been
in
the
newspaper
office
when
news
of
the
railroad
disaster
was
received
,
with
Brently
Mallard
's
name
leading
the
list
of
""
killed
.
""
He
had
only
taken
the
time
to
assure
himself
of
its
truth
by
a
second
telegram
,
and
hurried
to
send
the
sad
message
.
 
She
did
not
hear
the
story
as
many
women
have
heard
the
same
.
She
wept
at
once
,
with
wild
abandonment
,
in
her
sister
's
arms
.
When
the
storm
of
sadness
had
spent
itself
she
went
away
to
her
room
alone
.
 
There
stood
,
facing
the
open
window
,
a
comfortable
armchair
.
Into
this
she
sank
,
pressed
down
by
a
physical
exhaustion
that
held
her
body
and
seemed
to
reach
into
her
soul
.
 
She
could
see
in
the
open
square
before
her
house
the
tops
of
trees
that
were
all
aquiver
with
the
new
spring
life
.
The
delicious
breath
of
rain
was
in
the
air
.
The
notes
of
a
distant
song
which
someone
was
singing
reached
her
,
and
countless
sparrows
were
twittering
in
the
eaves
.
 
There
was
something
coming
to
her
and
she
was
waiting
for
it
,
fearfully
.
What
was
it
?
It
was
too
hard
to
name
.
But
she
felt
it
,
coming
out
of
the
sky
,
reaching
toward
her
through
the
sounds
,
the
smells
,
the
color
that
filled
the
air
.
 
Now
her
chest
rose
and
fell
violently
.
She
was
beginning
to
recognize
this
thing
that
was
approaching
to
possess
her
,
and
was
trying
very
hard
to
beat
it
back
with
her
will
.
When
she
gave
up
trying
a
little
whispered
word
escaped
her
lips
.
She
said
it
over
and
over
under
the
breath
:
""
free
,
free
,
free
!
""
 
She
did
not
stop
to
ask
if
it
was
extreme
joy
that
held
her
.
She
knew
that
she
would
weep
again
when
she
saw
the
kind
,
gentle
hands
folded
in
death
;
the
face
that
had
never
looked
at
her
except
with
love
,
fixed
and
gray
and
dead
.
But
she
saw
beyond
that
bitter
moment
many
years
to
come
that
would
belong
to
her
absolutely
.
And
she
opened
and
spread
her
arms
out
to
them
in
welcome
.
 
There
would
be
no
one
to
live
for
during
those
coming
years
;
she
would
live
for
herself
.
There
would
be
no
powerful
will
bending
hers
.
 
And
yet
she
had
loved
him
--
sometimes
.
What
did
it
matter
!
What
could
love
count
for
in
the
face
of
her
realization
.
 
""
Free
!
Body
and
soul
free
!
""
she
kept
whispering
.
 
Josephine
was
kneeling
before
the
closed
door
with
her
lips
to
the
keyhole
.
""
Louise
,
open
the
door
!
I
beg
;
open
the
door
--
you
will
make
yourself
ill
.
""
 
""
Go
away
.
I
am
not
making
myself
ill
.
""
 
Her
fancy
was
running
wild
along
those
days
ahead
of
her
,
all
sorts
of
days
that
would
be
her
own
.
She
breathed
a
quick
prayer
that
life
might
be
long
.
It
was
only
yesterday
she
had
thought
with
a
shake
that
life
might
be
long
.
 
She
arose
after
a
long
time
and
opened
the
door
to
her
sister
's
begging
.
She
carried
herself
unknowingly
like
a
goddess
of
Victory
.
She
held
her
sister
's
waist
,
and
together
they
walked
down
the
stairs
.
 
Someone
was
opening
the
front
door
with
a
key
.
It
was
Brently
Mallard
who
entered
,
a
little
travel-stained
,
calmly
carrying
his
suitcase
and
umbrella
.
He
had
been
far
from
the
scene
of
the
accident
,
and
did
not
even
know
there
had
been
one
.
He
stood
amazed
at
Josephine
's
sharp
cry
;
at
Richards
'
quick
motion
to
screen
him
from
the
view
of
his
wife
.
 
When
the
doctors
came
they
said
she
had
died
of
heart
disease
--
of
the
joy
that
kills
."	"1

School
,
which
formed
part
of
the
Imagine
Children
's
Literature
Festival
last
autumn
.
Each
child
(
aged
12-13
)
beatified
a
box
and
wrote
a
story
on
the
subject
of
collections
to
throw
inside
it
.
The
boxes
were
spread
within
the
Royal
Festival
Hall
's
Ballroom
.
Some
were
left
empty
to
encourage
 
The
subject
chosen
by
Luren
was
an
imaginative
one
.
""
It
's
a
sort
o
f
Cinderella
story
,
""
she
told
me
,
inspired
by
a
collection
of
letters
from
her
cousin
,
ha
the
story
these
become
love
letters
,
burned
by
a
creel
stepmother
.
Lauren
's
best
friend
Charlotte
is
the
stepmother
.
""
I
'm
in
Charlotte
's
story
too
,
""
says
Lauren
,
""
and
I
get
run
over
.
""
Charlotte
's
tale
was
inspired
by
the
girls
'
coin
collection
.
""
We
've
collected
foreign
coins
for
years
-
since
our
families
went
on
holiday
to
Tenerife
.
""
she
explains
.
""
That
was
before
the
Euro
,
so
we
put
pesetas
in
.
""
Lauren
continues
:
""
I
fred
a
coin
in
the
road
,
go
to
get
it
and
get
run
over
.
I
'm
in
hospital
and
then
I
die
.
""
Charlotte
adds
:
""
Or
she
might
not
die
.
I
have
n't
decided
yet
.
""
 
Millie
Murray
,
who
is
a
tea-novel
author
,
thinks
that
setting
the
subject
of
collections
was
a
useful
inspiration
to
their
creativity
rather
than
a
restriction
.
""
In
the
beginning
I
thought
,
'Will
the
children
be
able
to
do
it
?
'
""
she
says
.
""
But
it
's
been
fruitful
.
Some
have
their
own
collection
,
some
have
parents
who
do
,
and
some
have
wlstten
complete
stories
.
It
's
made
them
think
about
something
they
would
n't
have
otherwise
,
winch
can
only
be
a
good
thing
.

"What
makes
15,000
men
and
women
run
for
hours
,
and
what
makes
them
run
through
the
streets
on
a
cold
day
without
coats
?
I
was
one
of
those
runners
.
The
race
is
called
marathon
.
 
I
had
never
run
more
than
eight
miles
before
,
and
here
I
was
training
.
Since
the
race
is
in
April
,
I
had
to
run
throughout
the
winter
,
and
in
Boston
,
winters
are
cold
.
For
most
people
,
just
putting
on
their
shirts
,
sweaters
,
jackets
,
and
hats
is
exercise
enough
.
I
found
myself
out
on
the
dark
streets
,
running
along
ice
sidewalks
.
Even
in
gloves
,
my
fingers
got
so
cold
that
they
looked
like
red
carrots
.
My
nose
did
n't
get
warm
until
lunchtime
!
 
Finally
,
the
big
day
arrived
.
The
weather
was
cold
,
with
ice
and
rain
.
Bang
!
The
gun
sounded
,
and
we
started
.
I
did
n't
go
anywhere
at
first
because
I
was
standing
behind
so
many
people
.
I
had
to
wait
for
them
to
move
.
 
At
first
,
the
running
was
easy
.
The
other
runners
just
seemed
to
pull
me
along
.
Somewhere
around
the
20-mile
mark
I
even
said
to
myself
,
""
This
is
nothing
,
why
did
I
train
so
hard
?
""
 
Then
I
hit
""
the
wall
""
.
""
The
wall
""
is
what
marathon
runners
call
the
special
point
.
I
knew
my
body
reached
the
point
and
I
thought
I
could
n't
go
any
more
.
I
was
out
of
breath
and
my
legs
turned
into
pieces
of
wood
.
I
was
almost
falling
down
.
I
ca
n't
remember
anything
about
the
last
five
miles
of
the
race
.
 
I
kept
running
though
.
At
last
,
I
heard
a
voice
at
the
finishing
line
.
 
""
You
look
good
,
""
my
friend
Ted
said
.
""
How
did
it
feel
?
""
 
""
Wonderful
!
""
I
replied
.
 
For
everything
,
if
you
devote
yourself
into
it
,
there
will
be
a
way
.
I
finished
the
race
,
at
least
,
in
my
heart
,
I
was
the
winner

"In
my
living
room
,
there
is
a
plaque
that
advises
me
to
""
Bloom
where
you
are
planted
.
""
It
reminds
me
of
Dorothy
.
I
got
to
know
Dorothy
in
the
early
1980s
,
when
I
was
teaching
Early
Childhood
Development
through
a
program
with
Union
College
in
Barbourville
,
Kentucky
.
The
job
responsibilities
requested
occasional
visits
to
the
classroom
of
each
teacher
in
the
program
.
Dorothy
stands
out
in
my
memory
as
one
who
""
bloomed
""
in
her
remote
area
.
 
Dorothy
taught
in
a
school
In
Harlan
County
,
Kentucky
,
Appalachian
Mountain
area
.
To
get
to
her
school
from
the
town
of
Harlan
,
I
followed
a
road
winding
around
the
mountain
.
In
the
eight-mile
journey
,
I
crossed
the
same
railroad
track
five
times
,
giving
the
possibility
of
getting
caught
by
the
same
train
five
times
.
Rather
than
feeling
excited
by
this
drive
through
the
mountains
,
I
found
it
depressing
.
The
poverty
level
was
shocking
and
the
small
shabby
houses
gave
me
the
greatest
feeling
of
hopelessness
.
 
From
the
moment
of
my
arrival
at
the
little
school
,
all
gloom
disappeared
.
Upon
arriving
at
Dorothy
's
classroom
.
I
was
greeted
with
smiling
faces
and
treated
like
a
queen
.
The
children
had
been
prepared
to
show
me
their
latest
projects
.
Dorothy
told
me
with
a
big
smile
that
they
were
serving
poke
greens
salad
and
cornbread
for
""
dinner
""
(
lunch
)
.
In
case
you
do
n't
know

Dorothy
never
ran
out
of
reports
of
exciting
activities
of
her
students
.
Her
enthusiasm
never
cooled
down
.
When
it
came
time
to
sit
for
the
testing
and
interviewing
required
to
receive
her
Child
Development
Associate
Certification
,
Dorothy
was
ready
.
She
came
to
the
assessment
and
passed
in
all
areas
.
Afterward
,
she
invited
me
to
the
one-and-only
steak
house
in
the
area
to
celebrate
her
victory
,
as
if
she
had
received
her
Ph
.
D.
degree
.
After
the
meal
,
she
placed
a
little
box
containing
an
old
pen
in
my
hand
.
She
said
it
was
a
family
heirloom
,
but
to
me
it
is
a
treasured
symbol
of
appreciation
and
pride
that
can
not
be
matched
with
things
.

"When
learning
a
second
language
,
it
is
important
to
study
the
culture
of
the
language
you
're
learning
.
Anyone
can
learn
another
language
's
grammar
from
a
textbook
,
but
what
good
is
this
learning
if
you
do
n't
understand
the
culture
of
the
person
you
're
speaking
to
?
Only
in
learning
another
language
and
its
culture
will
you
be
able
to
proficiently
communicate
with
a
person
in
that
language
.
There
are
many
ways
to
enhance
your
language
studies
by
studying
the
country
's
culture
;
this
can
include
reading
literature
,
watching
movies
,
or
listening
to
popular
music
.
 
Many
schools
in
the
United
States
emphasize
the
importance
of
culture
understanding
in
language
classes
.
Instead
of
memorizing
only
vocabulary
words
and
grammar
patterns
,
classes
from
elementary
schools
to
universities
are
teaching
literature
,
pop
songs
,
and
films
in
their
classes
.
From
these
various
mediums
students
can
learn
a
great
deal
about
the
culture
of
a
language
they
study
.
These
different
forms
of
media
can
teach
various
characteristics
about
the
language
,
culture
,
and
history
of
a
society
.
 
Literature
can
allow
you
to
understand
the
history
and
current
debates
confronting
a
culture
.
For
example
,
if
you
read
John
Steinbeck
's
GraPes
of
Wrath
you
can
understand
the
history
and
problems
of
ordinary
American
farmers
in
the
Great
Depression
.
In
watching
films
one
can
learn
about
what
is
popular
in
a
society
,
and
also
slang
phrases
one
definitely
wo
n't
find
in
a
textbook
.
In
pop
songs
one
can
understand
what
the
current
craze
in
a
culture
is
;
what
kind
of
music
people
like
to
listen
to
,
what
that
culture
finds
romantic
,
and
even
what
the
contemporary
""
cool
""
viewpoint
in
that
society
is
.
 
If
you
truly
are
interested
in
learning
a
language
,
do
n't
underestimate
the
importance
of
learning
about
the
language
's
home
culture
.
Of
course
one
must
learn
a
language
's
grammar
and
vocabulary
,
but
this
will
only
get
you
so
far
in
actually
being
able
to
communicate
effectively
.
So
if
you
are
learning
a
language
,
take
the
time
to
also
study
the
culture

"When
people
who
are
nature
lovers
worldwide
wish
all
humans
to
realize
the
importance
of
their
natural
surroundings
,
many
Australians
are
turning
caring
for
the
environment
into
a
way
of
life
.
 
Julie
,
an
Australian
housewife
in
Brisbane
is
one
such
example
.
Even
though
autumn
is
approaching
Australia
's
Brisbane
in
April
,
one
can
still
watch
colorful
blooming
flowers
in
Julie
's
little
garden
,
as
she
tells
that
in
her
community
,
""
Each
of
us
has
a
beautiful
yard
.
The
whole
community
,
from
children
to
elderly
people
,
takes
care
of
the
environment
as
if
they
are
taking
care
of
their
own
garden
.
""
 
""
Gardening
is
the
most
popular
club
in
our
community
,
""
she
says
.
""
A
lot
of
retired
people
do
n't
just
regularly
organize
gardening
lectures
,
but
also
personally
visit
families
in
the
community
to
provide
gardening
training
.
So
you
can
see
that
flowers
continue
to
blossom
in
our
gardens
throughout
the
year
.
""
 
Talking
about
her
people
's
sense
of
caring
for
the
environment
,
Julie
says
when
people
in
the
community
take
along
their
dog
,
they
always
carry
a
garbage
bag
to
deal
with
the
dog
's
waste
.
""
In
our
community
,
you
will
never
experience
the
embarrassment
of
stepping
on
the
dirty
waste
while
you
are
walking
on
the
grass
,
""
says
Julie
with
a
smile
.
""
Taking
care
of
the
dog
's
waste
can
also
help
to
develop
children
's
sense
of
responsibility
!
""
 
As
to
protecting
water
resources
,
the
Australian
government
has
made
strict
rules
for
families
.
Julie
says
,
""
We
certainly
would
not
use
tap
water
to
water
the
flowers
!
""
She
says
almost
every
family
in
her
community
has
a
huge
tank
used
to
store
rainwater
,
which
is
later
used
as
the
resource
of
all
outdoor
water
use
,
including
car
washing
and
watering
the
garden
.
This
year
,
they
also
asked
people
to
connect
the
water
tank
with
their
toilets

"Recently
,
many
people
have
begun
to
try
a
new
way
of
doing
shopping
through
the
Internet
.
They
are
very
interested
in
it
.
Why
is
it
becoming
more
and
more
popular
now
?
There
are
some
reasons
.
First
,
more
and
more
people
have
their
own
computers
and
their
computers
can
be
joined
with
the
Internet
.
So
it
is
possible
for
many
of
them
to
do
shopping
through
the
Internet
.
Second
,
shopping
through
the
Internet
can
save
them
some
money
and
a
lot
of
time
.
Third
,
they
do
n't
need
to
go
to
the
shop
themselves
.
Because
of
these
good
facts
,
few
people
refuse
it
.
 
On
the
other
hand
,
some
people
do
n't
like
this
new
way
of
shopping
.
They
are
worried
about
the
safety
of
shopping
online
.
Customers
can
only
see
the
pictures
of
a
product
on
the
Internet
.
And
they
ca
n't
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
buying
things
in
a
large
supermarket
or
a
wonderful
shopping
center
.
These
are
the
reasons
why
they
do
not
like
it
.
But
I
think
more
and
more
people
will
like
this
new
kind
of
shopping
in
the
future

Taobao

has
become
an
important

of
Wang

She

A
growing
number
of
Chinese
Internet

Wang
have
found
the
joys
of
online

.
Most
online

are
students

More
women

than
men

Clothing

It

"Children
seem
to
care
so
much
about
their
names
.
A
study
showed
that
25
%
of
young
children
feel
they
could
n't
live
any
more
if
you
took
away
their
name
.
Another
study
shows
that
about
one
third
of
all
young
people
wish
their
parents
had
given
them
a
different
name
.
 
In
many
cultures
,
there
are
special
ideas
about
how
to
choose
a
name
.
For
example
,
many
people
choose
a
name
that
has
been
in
their
family
for
many
years
.
It
tells
the
child
where
he
or
she
has
come
from
.
 
Choosing
a
good
name
is
n't
easy
.
Many
parents
search
books
that
tell
them
the
meanings
of
names
.
They
could
choose
a
name
that
carries
a
message
.
For
example
,
Edith
means
""
valuable
gift
""
.
Amanda
means
""
love
""
.
And
Fara
means
""
joy
""
.
 
Names
like
these
tell
family
and
friends
how
happy
they
are
with
their
new
baby
.
Other
names
can
say
something
about
the
events
during
the
birth
of
the
child
.
In
Africa
,
a
first
born
son
may
have
the
name
Mosi
and
the
name
Ama
means
""
born
on
Saturday
""
.
 
But
can
our
names
influence
our
lives
?
Some
experts
say
that
they
can
,
but
others
disagree
.
Is
every
girl
called
Malak
like
an
angel
?
Is
every
boy
called
Curitis
polite
?
And
is
every
girl
called
Mahira
quick
and
full
of
energy
?
No
parent
can
tell
what
kind
of
person
their
child
will
grow
up
to
be
.
Just
because
parents
name
a
boy
Fahim
,
it
does
n't
mean
he
will
be
clever
.
All
they
can
do
is
to
hope

"Grown-ups
are
often
surprised
by
how
well
they
remember
something
they
learned
as
children
but
have
never
practiced
ever
since
.
A
man
who
has
not
had
a
chance
to
go
swimming
for
years
can
still
swim
as
well
as
ever
when
he
gets
back
in
the
water
.
He
can
get
on
a
bicycle
after
many
years
and
still
ride
away
.
He
can
play
catch
and
hit
a
ball
as
well
as
his
son
.
A
mother
who
has
not
thought
about
the
words
for
years
can
teach
her
daughter
the
poem
that
begins
""
Twinkle
,
twinkle
,
little
star
""
or
remember
the
story
of
Cinderella
or
Goldilocks
and
the
Three
Bears
.
 
One
explanation
is
the
law
of
overlearning
,
which
can
be
stated
as
follows
:
Once
we
have
learned
something
,
additional
learning
trials
increase
the
length
of
time
we
will
remember
it
.
 
In
childhood
we
usually
continue
to
practice
such
skills
as
swimming
,
bicycle
riding
,
and
playing
baseball
long
after
we
have
learned
them
.
We
continue
to
listen
to
and
remind
ourselves
of
words
such
as
""
Twinkle
,
twinkle
,
little
star
""
and
childhood
tales
such
as
Cinderella
and
Goldilocks
.
We
not
only
learn
but
overlearn
.
 
The
multiplication
tables
are
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
that
we
forget
rather
quickly
the
things
that
we
learn
in
school
,
because
they
are
another
of
the
things
we
overlearn
in
childhood
.
The
law
of
overlearning
explains
why
cramming
for
an
examination
,
though
it
may
result
in
a
passing
grade
,
is
not
a
satisfactory
way
to
learn
a
college
course
.
By
cramming
,
a
student
may
learn
the
subject
well
enough
to
get
by
on
the
examination
,
but
he
is
likely
soon
to
forget
almost
everything
he
learned
.
A
little
overlearning
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
really
necessary
for
one
's
future
development"	"1

"Lohri
is
an
agricultural
festival
,
filled
with
merrymaking
.
It
is
celebrated
in
the
state
of
Punjab
on
the
13th
of
January
,
which
falls
one
day
before
Makar
Sankranti
.
While
Lohri
is
essentially
a
Punjabi
festival
,
it
is
celebrated
in
some
other
states
of
North
India
as
well
.
In
cities
like
Delhi
,
which
has
a
large
population
,
Lohri
is
celebrated
to
show
the
end
of
the
coldest
days
of
winter
.
The
last
week
of
December
and
the
first
two
weeks
of
January
are
usually
the
coldest
period
in
Punjab
and
other
areas
of
North
India
.
However
,
after
Lohri
,
the
temperature
starts
to
rise
.
 
During
the
day
,
children
go
from
door
to
door
singing
songs
in
praise
of
Dulha
Bhatti
,
the
Punjabi
translation
of
Robin
Hood
,
a
thief
who
helped
the
poor
and
fought
for
their
rights
.
These
children
are
given
sweets
and
food
,
and
sometimes
they
are
also
given
money
.
These
munchies
that
the
children
collect
are
known
as
Lohri
,
and
they
are
distributed
at
night
during
the
festival
.
 
The
festival
of
Lohri
is
celebrated
outdoors
.
As
it
is
usually
very
cold
on
the
13th
of
January
,
a
bonfire
is
lit
,
and
friends
and
s
gather
around
.
If
there
has
been
a
happy
occasion
in
the
family
,
like
the
birth
of
a
child
or
a
marriage
,
Lohri
is
celebrated
with
much
greater
happiness
.
The
happy
family
usually
hosts
a
party
to
celebrate
the
first
Lohri
of
the
new
child
or
couple
.
 
Singing
and
dancing
form
an
important
part
of
the
celebrations
.
People
wear
their
brightest
clothes
and
come
to
dance
the
bhangra
and
gidda
to
the
best
of
the
dhol
.
Punjabi
songs
are
sung
,
and
everybody
is
happy

"Snack
time
is
a
part
of
the
day
for
children
of
all
ages
.
But
new
research
suggests
that
kids
snacking
in
big
groups
could
be
at
risk
for
obesity
.
 
Scientists
from
American
University
looked
at
the
eating
behavior
of
54
kids
between
the
ages
of
2
and
6
.
At
snack
time
,
the
scientist
watched
the
amount
of
food
each
child
ate
while
they
were
in
groups
of
either
three
or
nine
.
According
to
the
study
,
the
more
children
there
are
in
a
group
,
the
more
likely
they
are
to
eat
more
.
Those
in
the
larger
group
ate
nearly
30
percent
more
than
those
in
the
smaller
group
,
and
they
actually
ate
faster
.
 
Since
this
is
the
first
such
study
in
children
,
scientists
are
quick
to
point
out
the
importance
of
encouraging
healthy
habits
in
kids
as
early
as
possible
.
 
""
If
you
know
kids
eat
more
in
large
groups
,
it
seems
perfect
to
use
this
information
to
keep
snack
groups
small
or
use
small
tables
,
""
says
Dr.
Jana
Klauer
,
an
expert
in
New
York
.
 
Smaller
groups
would
allow
for
a
quiet
and
more
relaxing
environment-a
perfect
chance
to
teach
children
about
food
,
manners
and
how
to
know
when
they
feel
full
.
""
This
would
have
an
effect
on
kids
'
eating
,
""
adds
Klauer
.
""
They
would
slow
down
and
eat
less
.

Dear
editor
,
 
Under
China
's
current
educational
system
,
there
are
those
who
do
nothing
but
study
.
They
of
course
are
thought
to
be
model
students
.
 
But
I
feel
that
there
is
another
type
of
student
who
,
perhaps
not
as
diligent
as
the
first
type
,
uses
his
time
more
efficiently
and
achieves
a
lot
academically
.
 
Last
year
,
a
classmate
of
mine
was
accepted
by
a
top
university
.
It
surprised
all
of
us
.
It
was
because
,
unlike
most
of
us
,
he
did
n't
spend
too
much
of
his
time
studying
.
 
When
I
asked
him
the
secret
of
his
success
,
he
said
that
the
key
was
properly
and
scientifically
arranging
his
time
.
 
""
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
keeping
fit
and
as
a
result
,
I
was
able
to
better
concentrate
on
my
class
work
.
""
 
The
moral
of
the
story
is
:
it
is
n't
necessary
to
sit
at
your
desk
all
day
long
to
get
high
academic
grades
.
 
Yours
,
 
Zhang

"The
person
behind
you
constantly
kicks
the
back
of
your
seat
.
Your
talkative
seatmate
does
n't
understand
your
need
for
sleep
.
And
the
aircraft
's
bathroom
is
a
total
mess
.
These
situations
can
make
even
a
short
flight
unbearable
.
Hopefully
you
do
n't
cause
these
unpleasant
experiences
for
others
.
Instead
,
you
can
set
an
example
by
following
these
common
airplane
courtesies
.
 
Always
recline
your
seat
slowly
.
There
's
nothing
worse
than
suddenly
being
slammed
in
the
knees
by
the
seat
in
front
of
you
.
In
addition
,
do
n't
keep
your
seat
reclined
for
the
entire
flight
.
Always
keep
it
upright
position
before
going
to
the
restroom
(
or
anytime
you
leave
your
seat
)
.
 
Avoid
going
to
the
bathroom
during
mealtime
.
Wait
until
the
meal
is
done
and
all
the
food
trays
have
been
collected
.
It
's
hard
for
passengers
to
stand
up
to
let
you
pass
when
they
still
have
their
food
trays
.
And
when
using
the
bathroom
,
always
clean
up
after
your-self-the
next
user
will
be
grateful
!
 
Keep
your
body
--
and
your
possessions-to
yourself
as
much
as
possible
so
as
not
to
crowd
your
in-flight
seatmate
(
s
)
.
Share
the
armrest
,
especially
on
a
long
flight
.
Also
,
be
careful
not
to
kick
or
push
on
the
seat
in
front
of
you
,
and
do
n't
allow
your
children
to
do
so
either
.
 
While
some
people
enjoy
chatting
with
other
passengers
during
a
flight
,
not
everyone
does
.
Some
people
may
want
to
nap
,
read
or
work
.
If
the
conversation
seems
one
--
sided
,
take
the
hint
.
 
If
you
are
traveling
with
someone
and
want
to
chat
,
keep
your
voices
low
.
If
using
electronic
gadgets
,
keep
the
volume
down
.
People
can
still
hear
through
your
headphones
if
the
volume
is
too
high
.
 
When
exiting
the
plane
,
if
others
are
having
trouble
with
their
carry-on
luggage
,
help
them
if
you
can
.
If
you
ca
n't
help
,
wait
patiently
,
and
do
n't
push
past
people
to
get
off
the
airplane
.
 
On
your
next
flight
,
remember
that
it
all
boils
down
to
the
golden
rule
.
Treat
others
the
way
you
want
to
be
treated

"There
are
hundreds
of
expressions
of
words
using
""
hand
""
in
the
English
language
.
Let
us
examine
some
of
the
expressions
that
use
""
hand
""
.
 
We
will
get
a
hand
in
this
way
.
""
To
get
a
hand
in
""
is
to
begin
a
job
,
to
begin
to
know
something
about
it
.
When
we
learn
completely
,
we
will
be
able
to
do
it
hands
down
.
If
we
do
the
job
well
,
we
may
end
up
with
the
upper
hand
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
situation
gets
out
of
hand
,
it
is
out
of
control
.
 
We
must
consider
another
way
of
expressing
phrase
--
--
to
hand
it
to
someone
.
For
example
,
I
must
hand
it
to
you
for
understanding
what
we
have
discussed
this
far
.
You
can
also
lend
a
hand
to
someone
but
without
really
giving
up
your
hand
.
You
lend
a
hand
when
you
help
someone
.
If
someone
is
kind
enough
to
lend
us
a
hand
then
we
surely
do
not
want
to
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
us
.
We
do
not
want
to
repay
his
kindness
by
treating
him
badly
.
 
Now
,
we
have
a
free
hand
to
continue
examining
other
""
hand
""
expressions
.
It
means
you
are
free
to
act
without
getting
permission
from
someone
else
.
 
Maybe
you
can
find
a
friend
who
wants
to
take
a
hand
in
our
project
.
It
would
have
to
be
someone
who
was
interested
in
these
expressions
.
Your
friend
may
want
to
work
hand
in
glove
with
us
.
That
is
good
because
that
means
he
wants
to
work
as
closely
with
us
as
a
glove
covers
the
hand
.
Of
course
,
there
is
a
danger
that
he
may
look
at
our
project
and
decide
to
take
it
in
hand
.
That
means
he
wants
to
tale
it
over
.
If
that
happens
,
we
may
throw
up
our
hands
because
the
situation
seams
hopeless
.
In
fact
,
we
may
decide
that
it
is
time
for
us
to
end
this
project
to
wash
our
hands
of
""
hand
""
expressions

*Essay-Writing
Tips
 
1.Catch
your
readers
'
interests
--
Your
opening
should
immediately
pull
your
readers
into
your
essay
.
Asking
a
question
or
starting
with
an
story
,
quotation
,
or
surprising
statement
is
a
good
way
to
do
this
.
 
2.Create
a
picture
--
Use
active
words
that
show
your
readers
what
is
happening
.
Instead
of
telling
your
readers
vaguely
that
""
the
room
was
disordered
""
,
paint
a
picture
using
active
verbs
and
lively
adjectives
.
 
3.Have
a
purpose
--
Well-written
essays
do
more
than
just
describe
an
incident
or
express
a
viewpoint
,
and
they
also
communicate
a
message
.
 
4.Check
for
mistakes
--
Read
your
paper
over
to
check
for
mistakes
.
Ask
another
student
to
read
your
paper
and
make
suggestions
.
Another
pair
of
eyes
will
often
spot
a
mistake
you
've
overlooked
.
 
5.Format
your
essay
--
Neatly
type
your
essay
on
white
paper
.
Choose
an
attractive
cover
for
submission

"The
weather
is
getting
warmer
and
warmer
.
It
is
fun
to
play
outside
,
but
people
are
afraid
to
play
outside
these
days
,
because
of
the
H7N9
virus
.
The
H7N9
virus
is
one
type
of
influenza
A
H7
viruses
.
It
is
a
new
type
of
bird
flu
.
Influenza
A
H7
viruses
mainly
affectbirds
but
sometimes
they
can
also
affect
humans
.
Most
people
infected
with
H7N9
virus
look
like
they
had
a
common
flu
.
They
had
a
fever
,
a
cough
and
shortness
of
breath
.
Some
had
bad
pneumonia
.
This
March
,
H7N9
virus
hit
Shanghai
,
Anhui
,
Jiangsu
and
Zhejiang
.
Up
until
April
11th
,
the
number
of
people
infected
had
reached
35
.
Nine
of
these
people
died
.
 
But
do
n't
be
afraid
,
some
cases
are
curable
.
A
4-year-old
boy
in
Shanghai
and
a
67-year-old
man
in
Hangzhou
got
the
virus
,
and
they
are
getting
better
.
Besides
,
it
's
not
easy
to
be
infected
by
the
H7N9
virus
.
 
There
are
some
ways
to
save
ourselves
from
this
.
First
,
wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
running
water
before
you
eat
and
after
you
use
the
toilet
.
You
should
do
the
same
after
you
touch
animals
or
animal
waste
.
Second
,
cover
your
nose
and
mouth
with
your
elbow
when
coughing
.
Third
,
you
should
have
a
good
rest
and
do
some
exercises
,
so
your
body
can
become
strong
enough
to
beat
the
virus

"Tayka
Hotel
De
Sal
 
Where
:
Tahua
,
Bolivia
 
How
much
:
About
$
95
a
night
 
Why
it
's
cool
:
You
've
stayed
at
hotels
made
of
brick
or
wood
,
but
salt
?
That
's
something
few
can
claim
.
Tayka
Hotel
de
Sal
is
made
totally
of
salt
--
including
the
beds
(
though
you
'll
sleep
on
regular
mattresses
and
blankets
)
.
The
hotel
sits
on
the
Salar
de
Uyuni
,
a
prehistoric
dried-up
lake
that
's
the
world
's
biggest
salt
flat
.
Builders
use
the
salt
from
the
4,633-square-mile
flat
to
make
the
bricks
,
and
glue
them
together
with
a
paste
of
wet
salt
that
hardens
when
it
dries
.
When
rain
starts
to
dissolve
the
hotel
,
the
owners
just
mix
up
more
salt
paste
to
strengthen
the
bricks
.
 
Green
Magic
Nature
Resort
 
Where
:
Vythiri
,
India
 
How
much
:
About
$
240
a
night
 
Why
it
's
cool
:
Riding
a
pulley
-operated
lift
86
feet
to
your
treetop
room
is
just
the
start
of
your
adventure
.
As
you
look
out
of
your
open
window
--
there
is
no
glass
!
--
you
watch
monkeys
and
birds
in
the
rain
forest
canopy
.
Later
you
might
test
your
fear
of
heights
by
crossing
the
handmade
rope
bridge
to
the
main
part
of
the
hotel
,
or
just
sit
on
your
bamboo
bed
and
read
.
You
do
n't
even
have
to
come
down
for
breakfast
--
the
hotel
will
send
it
up
on
the
pulley-drawn
""
elevator
""
.
 
Dog
Bark
Park
Inn
B
&
B
 
Where
:
Cottonwood
,
Idaho
 
How
much
:
$
92
a
night
 
Why
it
's
cool
:
This
doghouse
is
n't
just
for
the
family
pet
.
Sweet
Willy
is
a
30-foot-tall
dog
with
guest
rooms
in
his
belly
.
Climb
the
wooden
stairs
beside
his
hind
leg
to
enter
the
door
in
his
side
.
You
can
relax
in
the
main
bedroom
,
go
up
a
few
steps
to
the
loft
in
Willy
's
head
,
or
hang
out
inside
his
nose
.
Although
you
have
a
full
private
bathroom
in
your
quarters
,
there
is
also
a
toilet
in
the
12-foot-tall
fire
hydrant
outside
.
 
Gamirasu
Cave
Hotel
 
Where
:
Ayvali
,
Turkey
 
How
much
:
Between
$
130
and
$
475
a
night
.
 
Why
it
's
cool
:
This
is
caveman
cool
!
Experience
what
it
was
like
5,000
years
ago
,
when
people
lived
in
these
mountain
caves
formed
by
volcanic
ash
.
But
your
stay
will
be
much
more
modern
.
Bathrooms
and
electricity
provide
what
you
expect
from
a
modern
hotel
,
and
the
white
volcanic
ash
,
called
tufa
,
keeps
the
rooms
cool
,
about
65degFin
summer
.
(
Do
n't
worry
--
there
is
heat
in
winter
.

"Treetops
,
the
hotel
in
the
trees
,
are
famous
in
the
world
.
People
know
little
about
Kenya
,
but
they
know
of
Treetops
.
When
King
George
VI
died
,
Princess
Elizabeth
was
staying
on
the
Treetops
,
and
when
she
came
down
from
there
,
""
She
succeeded
him
as
the
queen
of
the
country
""
.
 
The
hotel
is
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
,
and
it
shows
the
pleasure
of
Africa
.
When
you
visit
it
,
you
will
be
sent
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
by
hotel
buses
,
and
then
a
guide
,
with
a
gun
to
protect
you
against
big
game
,
will
go
with
you
to
the
Treetops
.
Before
and
after
dinner
,
for
the
whole
night
if
you
wish
,
you
can
sit
on
the
corridor
,
watching
animals
come
to
the
water
pool
.
The
earliest
hotel
Treetops
was
built
round
a
large
tree
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
water
,
but
that
was
destroyed
by
fire
and
the
new
hotel
Treetops
,
which
is
built
round
several
trees
,
is
much
bigger
.
 
The
dining
room
at
Treetops
is
small
,
and
the
waiters
can
not
walk
round
to
serve
guests
,
so
a
clever
""
railway
service
""
has
been
invented
.
Guests
take
their
food
as
it
passes
slowly
in
front
of
them
,
along
a
line
in
the
center
of
the
table
.
 
There
are
many
animals
around
the
Treetops
.
When
you
visit
them
,
you
can
see
:
 
--
-Animals
and
their
babies
are
waiting
to
greet
the
guests
.
 
--
-Animals
,
enjoying
the
Treetops
pool
in
the
daylight
.
 
--
-A
long
bodied
,
long
ring
tailed
very
active
cat-like
animal
is
a
special
one
coming
out
at
night
.
He
hunts
and
eats
anything
he
can
catch
and
is
very
destructive
.
He
lives
in
the
trees
at
Treetops
.
He
comes
for
his
food
every
evening
.
Do
not
get
too
near
to
him
,
as
his
teeth
and
claws
can
do
you
harm
.
These
animals
can
be
trained
and
become
lovely
pets

"This
year
,
some
twenty-three
hundred
teenagers
from
all
over
the
world
will
spend
about
ten
months
in
their
US
homes
.
They
will
attend
US
schools
,
meet
US
teenagers
,
and
form
impressions
of
the
real
America
.
At
the
same
time
,
about
thirteen
hundred
American
teenagers
will
go
to
other
countries
to
learn
new
languages
and
gain
a
new
understanding
of
the
rest
of
the
world
.
 
Here
is
a
two-way
students
exchange
in
action
.
Fred
,
nineteen
,
spent
last
year
in
Germany
with
George
's
family
.
In
turn
,
George
's
son
Mike
spent
a
year
in
Fred
's
home
in
America
.
 
Fred
knew
little
German
when
he
arrived
,
but
after
two
months
'
study
,
the
language
began
to
come
to
him
.
School
was
completely
different
from
what
he
had
expected
--
-
much
harder
.
Students
rose
respectfully
when
a
teacher
entered
the
room
.
They
took
fourteen
subjects
instead
of
the
six
that
are
usual
in
the
United
States
.
There
were
almost
no
extracurricular
activities
.
 
Family
life
,
too
,
was
different
.
The
father
's
word
was
law
,
and
all
activities
were
around
the
family
rather
than
the
individual
.
Fred
found
the
food
too
simple
at
first
.
Also
,
he
missed
having
a
car
.
 
'Back
home
,
you
pick
up
some
friends
in
a
car
and
go
out
and
have
a
good
time
.
In
Germany
,
you
walk
,
but
you
soon
learn
to
like
it
.
'
 
At
the
same
time
,
in
America
,
Mike
,
a
friendly
German
boy
,
was
also
forming
his
idea
.
'I
suppose
I
should
criticize
American
schools
,
'
he
said
.
'It
is
too
easy
by
our
level
.
But
I
have
to
say
that
I
like
it
very
much
.
In
Germany
we
do
nothing
but
study
.
Here
we
take
part
in
many
activities
.
There
ought
to
be
some
middle
ground
between
the
two
.

The
young
man
had
his
head
partly
out
of
the
window
and
spoke
to
me
as
I
moved
closer
,
""
Excuse
me
,
my
wife
and
I
are
trying
to
find
a
room
for
the
night
and
every
place
in
the
area
seems
to
be
filled
up
.
Do
you
have
any
suggestions
for
us
where
we
might
find
a
room
?
""
 
Well
,
that
did
n't
surprise
me
.
After
all
,
it
was
the
busy
time
of
the
year
for
tourism
.
As
he
spoke
,
I
noticed
that
his
wife
was
pregnant
.
I
told
them
that
they
should
just
keep
searching
and
wished
them
good
luck
in
their
search
.
The
young
husband
did
n't
say
any
other
words
and
backed
out
of
the
car-park
and
headed
off
.
We
also
got
into
our
car
and
drove
home
.
 
After
a
short
drive
,
I
could
n't
get
this
young
couple
out
of
my
mind
.
Here
they
were
,
traveling
in
a
different
state
,
tired
,
the
wife
pregnant
.
It
was
at
that
moment
that
my
wife
told
me
we
needed
to
go
back
and
find
that
couple
.
We
went
back
and
looked
for
them
.
We
even
went
as
far
as
the
mountain
.
I
'm
happy
that
this
story
had
a
happy
ending
.
We
found
them
in
the
end
,
gave
them
a
room
,
and
now
we
are
close
friends

"On
the
way
home
from
school
,
Jack
always
passes
a
park
.
His
mother
said
it
was
dangerous
to
pass
by
the
park
at
night
,
but
it
is
the
fastest
way
home
.
Today
,
after
finishing
soccer
practice
,
Jack
was
walking
toward
the
park
as
usual
.
 
Suddenly
,
Jack
heard
someone
calling
him
,
""
Excuse
me
!
""
Jack
turned
around
,
and
there
was
an
old
woman
.
""
Yes
,
ma'am
.
""
Jack
answered
politely
.
""
Do
n't
pass
by
the
park
tonight
.
""
Her
voice
was
weak
and
dry
.
""
Okay
,
ma'am
,
""
said
Jack
carelessly
.
The
old
woman
held
Jack
's
hand
strongly
,
and
said
,
""
I
mean
it
!
""
Jack
felt
the
hairs
on
his
neck
stand
up
.
As
soon
as
the
lady
let
go
of
his
hand
,
he
started
to
run
.
This
time
,
he
ran
so
fast
that
he
did
n't
have
time
to
think
where
he
was
going
.
 
When
he
stopped
,
he
realized
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
park
.
He
remembered
what
the
old
woman
had
said
,
but
it
was
too
late
.
He
thought
,
""
It
would
be
okay
if
I
run
really
fast
.
""
Suddenly
,
he
heard
someone
scream
.
Jack
was
too
frightened
to
wonder
who
it
was
.
He
breathed
as
deep
as
possible
.
The
screaming
continued
.
He
heard
some
fast
footsteps
approaching
,
so
he
turned
around
.
It
was
the
old
lady
!
She
walked
toward
him
,
and
shouted
""
I
told
you
not
to
come
here
!
""
 
Frightened
to
death
,
Jack
screamed
sharply
and
ran
home
like
an
arrow
.
He
thought
he
heard
not
only
the
old
lady
,
but
also
some
other
people
shouting
at
him
,
and
it
made
him
more
terrified
.
As
soon
as
Jack
saw
his
mother
,
Jack
said
,
""
Mom
!
Do
you
know
what
just
happened
at
the
park
?
""
Jack
's
mother
nodded
,
and
said
,
""
Yes
,
I
know
.
There
is
a
movie
shooting
tonight
in
the
park
.

"In
a
movie
,
a
woman
reads
a
storybook
to
her
friend
's
daughter
.
As
they
approach
the
last
page
,
she
reads
,
""
...
and
Cinderella
and
the
prince
lived
happily
ever
after
.
""
She
closes
the
book
and
looks
at
the
young
girl
,
adding
,
""
You
know
,
things
do
n't
always
happen
like
this
in
real
life
,
I
just
think
you
should
know
that
now
.
""
 
We
were
all
raised
on
fairy
tales
with
glass
slippers
,
brave
princes
and
magic
!
It
did
n't
take
too
long
to
realize
that
stories
like
that
are
n't
necessarily
true
.
In
real
life
,
you
learn
that
glass
slippers
are
really
uncomfortable
,
no
prince
is
perfect
and
magic
does
n't
always
work
.
 
So
what
do
you
do
when
the
way
you
planned
things
is
not
the
way
they
turned
out
?
 
Know
that
parts
of
your
fairy
tale
have
already
been
written
,
and
sadly
,
there
's
not
much
you
can
do
about
those
first
few
chapters
.
You
did
n't
get
the
best
start
.
Your
trust
was
unexpectedly
betrayed
.
You
did
n't
get
the
job
.
Whatever
falls
and
failures
happened
in
your
past
,
there
's
still
more
to
the
story
.
 
Your
life
has
a
lot
of
contributors
,
and
you
are
the
editor-in-chief
.
You
take
what
's
there
and
create
the
masterpiece
.
All
the
good
pages
and
the
bad
can
come
together
to
make
a
beautiful
adventure
.
 
When
you
find
yourself
wishing
your
life
was
more
like
the
fairy
tales
,
remember
that
in
some
ways
it
already
is
.
There
will
be
dragons
,
bad
witches
,
great
romances
,
winding
roads
and
friends
to
help
you
along
the
way
.
Live
your
life
carefully
and
positively
as
if
you
are
writing
a
long
story
.
Whether
it
's
a
comedy
,
tragedy
or
a
little
of
both
,
the
pen
is
in
your
hand
.
How
it
ends
is
all
up
to
you

"The
widespread
number
of
food
scandals
in
China
is
making
many
people
 
pause
before
they
put
their
chopsticks
in
their
mouths
.
They
are
wondering
if
the
food
 
they
are
eating
is
clean
,
healthy
and
nutritious
or
does
it
contain
something
harmful
 
that
will
cause
disease
?
 
Most
of
the
food
we
eat
today
is
processed
food
.
That
means
the
foods
we
buy
in
stores
and
supermarkets
,
especially
packaged
foods
,
are
prepared
in
factories
.
Chemicals
are
added
to
the
foods
in
these
factories
to
make
them
look
better
,
taste
better
and
last
longer
on
the
shelf
.
The
chemicals
are
supposed
to
be
harmless
and
there
are
laws
that
regulate
which
chemicals
can
and
ca
n't
be
used
.
Unfortunately
,
some
producers
do
not
obey
the
laws
.
 
A
producer
of
steamed
buns
in
Zhejiang
Province
was
recently
discovered
to
be
breaking
the
law
.
He
was
adding
yellow
dye
and
other
banned
chemicals
to
the
buns
.
He
was
also
taking
old
buns
and
using
them
to
make
new
buns
.
Most
of
the
buns
were
sold
to
schools
and
eaten
by
students
...
like
you
!
 
Why
did
he
do
it
?
Why
did
he
break
the
law
and
endanger
people
's
health
?
The
answer
is
simple
:
he
wanted
to
make
more
money
.
It
was
a
moral
failing
,
and
this
is
at
the
heart
of
the
scandals
in
China
.
Too
many
people
focus
on
making
money
and
not
on
the
effects
their
action
can
have
on
others
.

"People
who
are
about
the
same
age
as
you
are
your
peers
.
Peers
include
your
friends
and
your
classmates
.
They
have
strong
influence
on
your
actions
.
Your
peers
influence
how
you
think
,
how
you
act
,
and
even
how
you
dress
.
Peer
pressure
is
the
influence
that
people
of
the
same
age
have
on
one
another
.
 
Sometimes
your
peers
influence
you
in
a
helpful
or
positive
way
.
A
friend
may
notice
that
you
have
problems
in
math
.
And
he
might
invite
you
to
join
a
study
group
or
show
you
how
to
solve
a
difficult
problem
during
lunch
.
Such
actions
are
helpful
to
you
.
 
Sometimes
your
peers
influence
you
in
a
negative
or
unhealthy
way
.
A
friend
might
offer
you
cigarettes
.
Cigarettes
are
harmful
to
your
health
.
Your
friend
knows
that
.
Your
friend
also
knows
that
underage
smoking
is
against
the
law
.
Yet
he
or
she
still
makes
the
offer
.
This
bad
influence
is
negative
peer
pressure
.
 
Your
peers
may
not
always
realize
they
are
influencing
you
in
a
negative
way
.
For
example
.
a
friend
might
invite
you
to
the
movies
.
You
would
love
to
go
,
but
you
have
a
lot
of
housework
to
do
.
In
situations
like
this
you
should
make
a
wise
decision
.
 
You
can
learn
to
deal
with
negative
peer
pressure
.
Keep
away
from
people
who
try
to
influence
your
behavior
in
harmful
ways
.
Though
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
no
,
it
's
really
necessary
to
learn
to
do
that
.
Follow
the
following
steps
.
First
.
look
at
the
person
and
say
no
in
a
firm
but
polite
voice
.
Make
sure
your
face
shows
that
you
are
serious
.
Let
the
person
know
you
will
not
back
down
.
Then
,
give
reasons
for
saying
no
.
Explain
why
you
wo
n't
do
what
the
person
wants
.
Remember
to
say
goodbye
and
walk
away
if
he
or
she
continues

scholars
are
making
original
and
valuable
contributions
in
all
fields
of
science
.
Industry
is
so
aware
of
this
resource
that
each
year
,
through
national
competitions
,
it
offers
tremendous
awards
among
teenagers
to
seek
out
the
brilliant
minds
across
the
country
.
 
As
seen
by
members
of
other
nations
,
this
emphasis
on
questioning
and
searching
is
bad
for
young
people
's
""
manners
""
.
Foreigners
often
feel
great
""
lack
of
respect
""
in
our
youth
.
Foreign
visitors
are
often
surprised
and
frequently
annoyed
to
find
junior
staff
members
""
daring
""
to
challenge
older
ones
or
argue
points
with
them
;
they
do
not
always
like
it
when
these
young
men
make
detailed
but
often
revolutionary
suggestions
.
One
's
own
plans
,
reports
of
analyses
may
be
looked
through
in
detail
--
-perhaps
even
challenged
--
-by
a
young
person
.
This
is
not
to
be
considered
a
loss
of
face
;
nor
is
it
a
sign
of
""
no
confidence
""
.
Our
whole
approach
to
research
is
different
.
Your
ideas
are
being
looked
at
,
not
you
yourself
.
To
us
the
two
are
quite
separate
.
This
is
the
way
our
mind
work
.
We
are
seeking
facts
;
we
are
not
challenging
you
as
a
person
.
So
,
too
,
even
in
social
conversation
you
will
find
that
people
often
argue
,
pick
an
idea
apart
,
ask
for
your
sources
or
challenge
your
conclusions
.
They
do
not
mean
to
be
rude
;
they
are
keenly
interested
and
merely
trying
to
explore
the
idea
in
greater
depth

"As
Sam
slowly
woke
,
he
got
a
funny
feeling
in
his
stomach
.
He
knew
he
would
have
to
do
something
that
he
had
been
afraid
to
do
for
a
long
time
.
 
The
school
bus
came
on
time
,
and
he
sat
with
his
friend
,
Billy
.
They
chatted
about
baseball
.
It
was
a
great
way
to
get
his
mind
off
what
he
had
to
do
later
.
As
they
got
close
to
the
school
,
he
could
feel
his
heart
beating
.
His
hands
were
starting
to
sweat
.
He
hated
this
!
 
He
entered
Mrs.
Owen
's
class
.
She
was
smiling
,
and
saying
hello
to
all
her
students
as
she
did
every
morning
.
 
""
Hi
,
Sam
!
""
she
said
as
he
walked
in
.
 
""
Hi
,
""
he
said
and
quickly
sat
in
his
seat
.
Then
the
class
began
to
take
their
spelling
test
.
He
looked
at
the
clock
.
The
time
was
near
.
He
hoped
he
was
not
first
!
Mrs.
Owens
said
it
was
time
to
begin
their
special
day
.
 
""
Sam
,
you
'll
be
first
.
""
Mrs.
Owens
said
to
the
class
,
""
Sam
has
worked
very
hard
on
his
report
on
Hawaii
,
and
I
know
it
is
very
interesting
.
""
 
Sam
nervously
greeted
his
class
.
Then
,
he
thought
about
the
fun
things
he
had
read
about
surfing
,
volcanoes
,
and
pineapples
in
Hawaii
,
and
he
started
to
talk
.
He
talked
in
front
of
the
whole
class
,
and
it
was
fun
.
The
class
clapped
as
he
finished
and
Mrs.
Owens
was
smiling
.
It
was
n't
terrible
at
all
and
he
knew
he
would
do
better
the
next
time

"After
having
exercise
in
the
gym
tonight
,
I
just
had
a
shower
to
relax
for
a
while
.
While
calming
myself
down
with
soft
music
,
I
started
to
recall
what
happened
in
the
daytime
and
wrote
it
down
.
 
The
accident
that
gave
me
much
thought
happened
on
my
way
to
the
gym
after
work
.
When
I
walked
about
half
way
,
I
saw
that
many
people
surrounded
something
on
the
roadside
and
they
were
worried
and
shocked
.
I
joined
them
and
found
there
was
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
.
I
noticed
that
he
was
a
young
man
around
30
years
old
.
He
looked
so
pale
and
very
thin
.
From
his
dressing
,
I
simply
judged
that
he
worked
in
the
office
.
The
hospital
ambulance
came
over
and
some
nurses
did
the
regular
check
for
him
.
A
nurse
said
that
there
was
nothing
serious
with
him
but
his
body
was
very
weak
,
which
should
be
caused
by
overwork
and
less
exercise
.
 
It
's
a
really
sad
thing
for
a
young
person
to
fall
down
in
the
street
.
A
couple
of
days
ago
,
I
read
a
magazine
mentioning
that
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
businessmen
and
white-collar
workers
with
unhealthy
bodies
.
Under
huge
pressure
,
they
put
all
their
time
and
energy
to
work
and
ca
n't
find
enough
time
for
a
good
meal
or
a
good
sleep
,
let
alone
exercise
.
But
they
forget
that
without
health
,
work
is
equivalent
to
zero
.
 
As
I
realize
how
important
it
is
to
put
the
health
matter
ahead
,
I
am
willing
to
do
more
exercise
.
I
know
exercise
can
bring
me
enjoyment
and
health
.
I
know
without
health
,
even
a
most
successful
career
and
a
great
quantity
of
money
will
lose
their
meanings
.
 
When
I
got
out
of
the
gym
,
I
felt
that
every
cell
in
my
body
was
refreshed
and
I
was
able
to
have
more
energy
to
write
the
words
above
.
The
feeling
in
sweat
was
wonderful

"One
thinks
of
princes
and
presidents
as
some
of
the
most
powerful
people
in
the
world
;
however
,
governments
,
elected
or
otherwise
,
sometimes
have
had
to
struggle
with
the
financial
powerhouses
called
tycoons
.
The
word
tycoon
is
relatively
new
to
the
English
language
.
It
is
Chinese
in
origin
but
was
given
as
a
title
to
some
Japanese
generals
.
The
term
was
brought
to
the
United
States
,
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
,
where
it
eventually
was
used
to
refer
to
magnates
who
acquired
immense
fortunes
from
sugar
and
cattle
,
coal
and
oil
,
rubber
and
steel
,
and
railroads
.
Some
people
called
these
tycoons
""
capitals
of
industry
""
and
praised
them
for
their
contributions
to
U.S.
wealth
and
international
reputation
.
Others
criticized
them
as
cruel
""
robber
barons
""
,
who
would
stop
at
nothing
in
pursuit
of
personal
wealth
.
 
The
early
tycoons
built
successful
businesses
,
often
taking
over
smaller
companies
to
eliminate
competition
.
A
single
company
that
came
to
control
an
entire
market
was
called
a
monopoly
.
Monopolies
made
a
few
families
very
wealthy
,
but
they
also
placed
a
heavy
financial
burden
on
consumers
and
the
economy
at
large
.
 
As
the
country
expanded
and
railroads
linked
the
East
Coast
to
the
West
Coast
,
local
monopolies
turned
into
national
corporations
called
trusts
.
A
trust
is
a
group
of
companies
that
join
together
under
the
control
of
a
board
of
trustees
.
Railroad
trusts
are
an
excellent
example
.
Railroads
were
privately
owned
and
operated
and
often
monopolized
various
routes
,
setting
rates
as
high
as
they
desired
.
The
financial
burden
this
placed
on
passengers
and
businesses
increased
when
railroads
formed
trusts
.
Farmers
,
for
example
,
had
no
choice
but
to
pay
,
as
railroads
were
the
only
means
they
could
use
to
get
their
grain
to
buyers
.
Exorbitant
goods
rates
put
some
farmers
out
of
business
.
 
There
were
even
accusations
that
the
trusts
controlled
government
itself
by
buying
votes
and
manipulating
elected
officials
.
In
1890
Congress
passed
the
Sherman
Antitrust
.
Act
,
legislation
aimed
at
breaking
the
power
of
such
trusts
.
The
Sherman
Antitrust
Act
focused
on
two
main
issues
.
First
of
all
,
it
made
illegal
any
effort
to
interfere
with
the
normal
conduct
of
interstate
trade
.
It
also
made
it
illegal
to
monopolize
any
part
of
business
that
operates
across
state
lines
.
 
Over
the
next
60
years
or
so
,
Congress
passed
other
antitrust
laws
in
an
effort
to
encourage
competition
and
restrict
the
power
of
larger
corporations

"Most
people
consider
skydiving
a
product
of
the
20th
century
,
but
its
history
actually
goes
further
back
than
that
.
The
Chinese
attempted
to
parachute
in
the
10th
century
,
a
thousand
years
before
we
did
.
The
Chinese
did
what
we
would
today
call
base
diving
;
that
is
,
they
jumped
off
a
place
that
would
allow
them
to
float
from
a
height
to
the
ground
.
 
The
first
person
to
attempt
to
parachute
was
a
Frenchman
named
Jacques
Garnerin
.
He
jumped
from
his
hot-air
balloon
at
the
end
of
the
18th
century
and
did
tricks
on
the
way
down
and
stupefied
the
crowds
by
landing
safely
on
the
ground
.
At
the
end
of
the
19th
century
,
Kathie
Paulus
,
a
brave
German
woman
,
became
famous
for
her
skydiving
skills
.
 
Once
the
airplane
was
invented
,
skydiving
took
on
a
whole
new
form
.
The
airplane
made
it
possible
to
dive
from
greater
heights
at
greater
speeds
,
allowing
for
more
range
in
the
movements
in
the
air
.
A
woman
named
Tiny
Broadwick
became
the
first
woman
to
jump
from
a
plane
in
1913
and
dive
free
fall
in
1914
.
 
Skydiving
was
not
called
skydiving
until
the
middle
of
the
1950s
,
when
Ronald
Young
invented
the
word
.
It
had
been
called
parachuting
before
this
and
was
mainly
used
by
the
military
to
land
troops
in
inland
locations
,
or
for
pilots
to
jump
out
of
their
planes
when
necessary
.
Once
World
War
I
was
over
,
parachuting
became
a
sport
,
which
we
now
call
skydiving
.
 
After
World
War
II
,
this
activity
became
more
a
hobby
than
a
military
action
.
Soldiers
were
trained
in
parachuting
and
enjoyed
the
thrill
so
much
that
they
continued
on
for
fun
.
From
this
,
teams
and
competitions
were
formed
.
Skydiving
schools
appeared
in
the
late
1950s
and
now
it
is
a
recognized
extreme
sport
enjoyed
by
many

"A
growing
number
of
students
in
the
United
States
are
studying
Mandarin
.
It
is
the
official
language
of
China
.
More
and
more
people
speak
Mandarin
than
those
who
speak
other
languages
in
the
world
.
 
Schools
that
teach
Mandarin
want
to
prepare
students
for
a
future
in
which
they
are
likely
to
work
with
people
from
China
.
Business
in
China
is
booming
,
and
that
trend
is
expected
to
grow
.
 
The
US
government
is
trying
to
encourage
even
more
public
schools
to
teach
Mandarin
.
Officials
are
considering
spending
about
$
1
billion
on
Mandarin
programs
in
schools
.
China
is
getting
involved
too
.
The
Chinese
government
has
donated
Mandarin
textbooks
to
US
schools
.
Some
schools
are
also
taking
part
in
teacher
exchange
programs
with
China
.
 
""
It
is
important
for
students
to
learn
Mandarin
and
Chinese
culture
,
""
said
Mary
Patterson
,
a
school
principal
in
Portland
,
Oregon
.
""
Students
who
do
so
will
have
wider
opportunities
when
they
become
adults
.

"Once
a
traveller
came
into
a
village
which
was
suffering
from
hunger
.
The
villagers
asked
him
to
leave
,
for
they
feared
he
wanted
them
to
give
him
food
.
They
told
him
that
there
was
no
food
.
The
traveller
explained
that
he
did
n't
need
any
food
and
that
,
in
fact
,
he
was
planning
to
make
a
soup
to
share
with
them
instead
.
The
villagers
watched
suspiciously
as
he
built
a
fire
and
filled
a
pot
with
water
With
great
ceremony
,
he
pulled
a
stone
from
a
bag
,
and
dropped
the
stone
into
the
pot
of
water
.
After
a
moment
,
he
smelt
the
soup
and
shouted
with
excitement
,
""
How
delicious
the
soup
is
!
""
As
the
villagers
began
to
show
interest
,
he
mentioned
how
good
the
soup
would
be
with
just
a
little
cabbage
in
it
.
A
villager
brought
out
a
cabbage
to
share
.
This
episode
repeated
itself
until
the
soup
had
cabbage
,
carrots
,
onions
,
and
beets
--
indeed
,
a
full
pot
of
soup
that
could
feed
everyone
in
the
village
was
ready
.
This
story
describes
when
there
are
not
enough
resources
,
humans
will
store
things
.
We
do
not
want
to
share
.
The
story
of
stone
soup
helps
us
realize
that
,
in
doing
so
,
we
often
prevent
ourselves
and
everyone
else
from
having
a
feast
.
The
meaning
of
this
story
goes
far
beyond
food
.
We
keep
to
ourselves
ideas
,
love
,
and
energy
,
thinking
we
will
be
richer
,
but
in
fact
we
make
the
world
,
and
ourselves
,
poorer
.
The
traveller
was
able
to
see
that
the
villagers
were
holding
back
,
and
he
had
the
ability
to
inspire
them
to
give
.
In
this
way
,
they
created
a
large
meal
that
none
of
them
could
have
created
alone
.
Are
you
like
one
of
the
villagers
?
If
you
come
forward
and
share
your
gifts
,
you
will
inspire
others
to
do
the
same
.
The
reward
is
a
feast
that
can
feed
many

"Medalists
of
the
1948
London
Olympic
Games
look
back
on
their
summer
of
victory
.
 
SAMMY
Lee
,
91
,
U.S
.
 
GOLD
AND
BRONZE
,
DIVING
 
I
first
had
my
Olympic
dream
at
12
,
when
they
held
the
1932
Olympics
in
Los
Angeles
.
My
father
and
I
were
at
a
grocery
store
,
and
I
asked
,
""
What
are
all
the
flags
doing
here
?
""
He
said
,
""
We
are
having
the
Olympic
Games
.
That
's
where
they
honor
the
greatest
athletes
in
the
world
.
""
I
said
,
""
Papa
,
someday
I
'm
going
to
be
an
Olympic
champ
.
""
 
Walking
up
the
10-meter
platform
,
I
thought
to
myself
,
""
I
've
waited
16
years
for
this
moment
.
Am
I
going
to
win
?
""
So
I
prayed
to
God
that
I
was
most
deserving
of
winning
the
Games
.
 
DAVID
BOND
,
90
,
BRITAIN
 
GOLD
,
SAILING
 
During
the
war
,
I
spent
six
years
in
Royal
Air
Force
.
I
think
in
general
,
the
1948
Olympics
meant
very
little
to
most
people
.
We
were
too
busy
after
the
war
to
be
worried
about
sport
very
much
anyway
.
 
Our
team
had
about
six
weeks
before
the
Olympics
down
at
Torquay
and
we
went
out
sailing
every
day
.
 
Winning
gold
was
quite
something
.
It
was
nice
to
stand
on
the
platform
with
lots
of
people
cheering
.
We
celebrated
by
going
to
a
big
dance
.
 
MICHAEL
LAPAGE
,
88
,
BRITAIN
 
SILVER
,
ROWING
 
I
started
rowing
when
I
was
14
.
I
joined
the
navy
in
1942
.
In
1945
the
war
came
to
an
end
and
I
started
rowing
again
.
 
In
1948
we
were
still
on
rations
:
4
oz
.
of
red
meat
a
week
.
But
the
United
States
had
all
the
meat
they
wanted
.
They
were
the
favorites
to
win
.
 
On
the
day
of
the
final
,
we
led
the
Americans
at
the
start
,
but
their
stronger
staying
power
took
them
through
to
win
.
There
were
no
ribbons
on
the
medals
,
so
we
just
showed
them
round
the
family
.
 
THOMAS
GODWIN
,
91
,
BRITAIN
 
BRONZE
,
CYCLING
 
At
14
I
left
school
and
got
a
job
delivering
groceries
on
a
bicycle
,
which
excited
my
interest
in
cycling
.
When
the
war
broke
out
,
I
volunteered
but
was
held
back
,
so
I
continued
riding
.
 
After
my
team
won
our
bronze
medals
,
we
went
home
just
round
the
corner
and
had
a
sit-down
and
a
chat
and
a
laugh
.
It
was
a
different
world
.
Money
was
never
,
never
thought
about

(

-
A
Japanese
university
is
giving
away
Apple
Inc
's
(
AAPL
.
O
)
trendy
iPhone
to
students
for
free
,
but
with
a
catch
:
the
device
will
be
used
to
check
their
attendance
.
 
The
project
,
which
is
being
tested
ahead
of
its
formal
launch
in
June
,
involves
550
first
and
second
year
students
and
some
staff
of
a
department
at
Aoyama
Gakuin
University
,
which
is
located
just
outside
Tokyo
in
Sagamihara
city
.
 
The
school
's
iPhones
are
meant
to
create
a
mobile
information
network
between
students
and
professors
,
but
they
are
also
a
convenient
way
for
the
teachers
to
take
attendance
in
class
.
As
students
enter
the
room
,
instead
of
writing
their
name
on
a
sheet
,
they
simply
type
in
their
ID
number
and
a
specific
class
number
into
an
iPhone
application
.
To
prevent
students
from
logging
in
from
home
or
outside
class
,
the
application
uses
GPS
location
data
and
checks
which
router
the
students
have
logged
in
to
.
 
""
We
do
n't
want
to
use
this
to
simply
take
attendance
.
Our
hope
is
to
use
this
to
develop
a
classroom
where
students
and
teachers
can
discuss
various
topics
,
""
professor
Yasuhiro
Iijima
told
Reuters
as
he
demonstrated
the
application
.
 
University
officials
insist
the
project
is
not
intended
to
infringe
on
students
'
privacy
or
track
them
down
.
 
""
With
Japanese
cellphones
it
's
possible
that
the
location
data
is
automatically
sent
.
However
,
with
the
iPhone
,
you
must
always
confirm
before
the
GPS
data
can
be
sent
,
""
Iijima
said
.
 
Many
of
the
students
testing
the
system
said
they
were
happy
with
it
.
 
""
Up
until
now
,
we
've
been
using
little
slips
of
paper
to
take
attendance
.
But
with
a
cell
phone
,
you
do
n't
have
to
spend
time
collecting
all
of
those
and
so
I
think
it
's
quite
nice
,
""
20-year-old
student
Yuki
Maruya
.
 
When
the
system
goes
fully
online
next
month
,
the
university
also
hopes
to
provide
video
podcasts
of
lectures
to
help
students
who
missed
classes
,
or
just
ca
n't
remember
their
lessons

"Weekends
are
normally
a
time
for
shopping
and
last
Saturday
was
no
exception
.
My
son
Henry
and
I
were
shopping
in
a
neighborhood
market
.
Henry
was
busy
weighing
each
new
bag
of
vegetables
I
selected
.
I
gave
him
a
bag
of
potatoes
and
he
walked
over
to
the
scale
and
waited
in
line
.
Suddenly
,
a
man
rushed
over
from
behind
,
and
stepped
before
him
,
hitting
him
out
of
the
way
.
Henry
looked
shocked
and
scared
.
Seeing
this
I
left
my
shopping
cart
and
walked
over
to
Henry
,
saying
loudly
,
""
Are
you
OK
,
honey
?
I
saw
what
that
man
did
to
you
.
That
was
very
,
very
wrong
.
""
 
When
the
man
finished
weighing
his
bag
,
his
sudden
turning
around
made
all
his
onions
fall
to
the
ground
.
The
three
of
us
stood
there
,
frozen
for
a
moment
.
And
then
I
bent
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
started
collecting
onions
.
After
I
handed
the
onions
to
the
man
,
he
accepted
them
and
put
them
into
his
bag
.
After
Henry
and
I
picked
up
all
the
onions
,
the
man
walked
away
without
saying
anything
.
We
did
n't
discuss
the
event
until
we
got
back
in
the
car
.
 
On
the
way
back
home
,
Henry
said
through
tears
,
""
Mommy
,
I
've
a
frustrating
day
.
That
man
cut
right
in
front
of
me
.
And
we
had
to
help
him
pick
up
his
onions
!
Why
did
we
do
that
?
That
did
n't
make
any
sense
!
""
 
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
said
,
""
Henry
,
that
man
seemed
to
have
a
very
bad
mood
today
.
We
should
forgive
him
.
I
was
also
angry
with
the
man
for
treating
you
rudely
.
I
really
wanted
to
kick
him
.
But
doing
that
does
n't
make
any
sense
.
If
we
had
n't
helped
him
,
we
might
have
felt
good
for
a
moment
,
but
then
I
bet
we
would
have
felt
really
sorry
for
a
long
time
.
You
and
I
have
a
lot
of
love
to
share
.
Maybe
that
man
does
n't
have
much
.
People
who
behave
badly
still
need
love
.
""
 
A
cheerful
smile
appeared
on
Henry
's
face
.
It
was
a
smile
of
promise
kept
.
It
was
the
best
smile
I
had
ever
seen
.
It
was
a
good
moment
.
It
may
have
been
my
best
mommy
moment
ever

"Happiness
can
mean
different
things
to
different
people
.
For
example
,
for
one
person
,
it
may
mean
being
in
a
relationship
,
while
for
someone
else
it
may
mean
feeling
you
have
the
ability
to
handle
whatever
life
throws
at
you
.
 
While
you
might
think
that
there
are
certain
things
that
make
you
happy
(
or
could
make
you
happy
if
you
had
them
)
,
research
has
shown
that
there
are
certain
common
qualities
among
happy
people
--
and
it
is
n't
necessarily
what
you
might
have
thought
.
 
You
might
think
that
happy
people
have
lots
of
money
,
are
physically
attractive
or
have
great
jobs
.
Or
,
you
might
just
think
happy
people
are
simply
lucky
,
and
are
bom
that
way
.
 
Research
suggests
,
however
,
that
there
are
a
number
of
variables
that
make
a
far
greater
contribution
to
happiness
than
outer
and
more
superficial
factors
.
 
That
does
n't
mean
that
if
you
have
a
lot
of
money
you
wo
n't
be
happy
,
or
that
having
a
lot
of
money
is
bad
,
it
just
means
that
other
factors
are
more
important
in
determining
happiness
.
In
fact
,
a
strong
positive
relationship
between
wealth
and
happiness
only
exists
for
those
who
live
below
the
poverty
line
and/or
who
are
unemployed
.
 
What
makes
happy
people
different
from
the
others
is
that
they
have
a
different
attitude-a
different
way
of
thinking
about
things
and
doing
things
.
They
""
interpret
""
the
world
in
a
different
way
,
and
go
about
their
lives
in
a
different
way
."	"1

"Josh
and
Amy
are
like
many
teenagers
these
days
.
They
have
jobs
to
do
to
help
out
around
the
home
.
Josh
washes
cars
for
his
neighbors
while
Amy
helps
their
neighbor
's
kids
with
their
homework
.
Like
many
families
,
both
of
Josh
and
Amy
's
parents
work
outside
the
home
.
 
Everyone
in
Josh
and
Amy
's
family
is
busy
.
Their
mom
works
in
an
office
and
often
has
to
stay
late
for
meetings
.
Their
father
owns
his
own
small
business
and
stays
late
to
finish
his
work
.
Josh
and
Amy
go
to
school
.
Both
belong
to
clubs
and
sports
teams
.
They
also
have
lots
of
friends
with
whom
they
want
to
spend
time
.
 
Josh
and
Amy
's
mom
leaves
for
work
at
7:00
in
the
morning
and
does
not
get
home
most
days
until
6:30
pm
.
The
same
is
true
for
their
dad
,
but
he
leaves
home
in
the
morning
even
earlier
.
 
Josh
and
Amy
's
parents
work
to
be
able
to
provide
for
their
family
.
They
need
money
to
pay
for
their
home
and
to
pay
their
bills
.
Next
year
they
want
to
buy
a
new
car
.
The
family
also
wants
to
go
on
a
vacation
to
California
.
Josh
and
Amy
need
clothes
,
books
,
and
other
things
for
school
.
Their
parents
are
also
saving
money
so
Josh
and
Amy
can
go
to
college
when
they
finish
high
school
.

"The
U.S.
Department
of
Labor
statistics
show
that
there
is
an
oversupply
of
college
trained
workers
and
that
this
oversupply
is
increasing
.
Already
there
have
been
more
than
enough
teachers
,
engineers
,
physicists
,
aerospace
experts
,
and
other
specialists
.
Yet
colleges
and
graduate
schools
continue
every
year
to
turn
out
highly
trained
people
to
compete
for
jobs
that
are
n't
there
.
The
result
is
that
graduates
can
not
enter
the
professions
for
which
they
were
trained
and
must
take
temporary
jobs
which
do
not
require
a
college
degree
.
 
On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
a
great
need
for
skilled
workers
of
all
sorts
:
carpenters
,
electricians
,
mechanics
,
plumbers
,
TV
repairmen
.
These
people
have
more
work
than
they
can
deal
with
,
and
their
annual
incomes
are
often
higher
than
those
of
college
graduates
.
The
old
gap
that
white
--
collar
workers
make
a
better
living
than
blue
collar
workers
no
longer
holds
true
.
The
law
of
supply
and
demand
now
favors
the
skilled
workmen
.
 
The
reason
for
this
situation
is
the
traditional
myth
that
college
degree
is
a
passport
to
a
prosperous
future
.
A
large
part
of
American
society
matches
success
in
life
equally
with
a
college
degree
.
Parents
begin
indoctrinating
their
children
with
this
myth
before
they
are
out
of
grade
school
.
High
school
teachers
play
their
part
by
acting
as
if
high
school
education
were
a
preparation
for
college
rather
than
for
life
.
Under
this
pressure
the
kids
fall
in
line
.
Whether
they
want
to
go
to
college
or
not
does
n't
matter
.
Everybody
should
go
to
college
,
so
of
course
they
must
go
.
And
every
year
college
enrollments
go
up
and
up
,
and
more
and
more
graduates
are
overeducated
for
the
kinds
of
jobs
available
to
them
.
 
One
result
of
this
emphasis
on
a
college
education
is
that
many
people
go
to
college
who
do
not
belong
there
.
Of
the
sixty
percent
of
high
school
graduates
who
enter
college
,
half
of
them
do
not
graduate
with
their
class
.
Many
of
them
drop
out
within
the
first
year
.
Some
struggle
on
for
two
or
three
years
and
then
give
up

"In
1905
,
as
part
of
his
Special
Theory
of
Relativity
,
Albert
Einstein
published
the
point
that
a
large
amount
of
energy
could
be
released
from
a
small
amount
of
matter
.
This
was
expressed
by
the
equation
E
=
mc2
.
But
bombs
were
not
what
Einstein
had
in
mind
when
he
published
this
equation
.
 
In
1929
,
he
publicly
declared
that
if
a
war
broke
out
he
would
""
refuse
to
do
war
service
,
direct
or
indirect
...
.
""
His
position
would
change
in
1933
,
as
the
result
of
Adolf
Hitler
's
coming
into
power
in
Germany
.
 
Einstein
's
greatest
role
in
the
invention
of
the
atomic
bomb
was
signing
a
letter
to
President
Franklin
Roosevelt
urging
that
the
bomb
be
built
because
some
physicists
feared
that
Germany
might
be
working
on
an
atomic
bomb
.
Among
those
concerned
were
physicists
Leo
Szilard
and
Eugene
Wigner
.
But
they
had
no
influence
with
those
in
power
.
So
in
July
1939
they
explained
the
problem
to
someone
who
did
:
Albert
Einstein
.
After
talking
with
Einstein
,
in
August
1939
Szilard
wrote
a
letter
to
President
Roosevelt
with
Einstein
's
signature
on
it
,
which
was
delivered
to
Roosevelt
in
October
1939
.
 
Germany
had
invaded
Poland
the
previous
month
,
the
time
was
ripe
for
action
.
That
October
research
of
a-bomb
began
but
proceeded
slowly
because
the
invention
of
the
atomic
bomb
seemed
distant
and
unlikely
.
In
April
1940
an
Einstein
letter
,
ghost-written
by
Szilard
,
pressed
the
researchers
on
the
need
for
""
greater
speed
""
.
 
As
the
realization
of
nuclear
weapons
grew
near
,
Einstein
looked
beyond
the
current
war
to
future
problems
that
such
weapons
could
bring
.
He
wrote
to
his
friend
about
his
fear
about
the
future
use
of
the
a-bomb
.
 
The
atomic
bombings
of
Japan
occurred
three
months
after
Germany
gave
in
.
 
In
November
1954
,
five
months
before
his
death
,
Einstein
summarized
his
feelings
about
his
role
in
the
creation
of
the
atomic
bomb
:
""
I
made
one
great
mistake
in
my
life
...
when
I
signed
the
letter
to
President
Roosevelt
recommending
that
atom
bombs
be
made
;
but
there
was
some
justification
--
-the
danger
that
the
Germans
would
make
them

"Global
warming
happens
when
greenhouse
gases
trap
heat
and
light
from
the
sun
in
the
earths
atmosphere
,
which
increases
the
temperature
.
This
is
like
when
heat
is
trapped
in
a
car
.
On
a
hot
day
,
the
car
gets
hotter
when
it
is
out
in
the
parking
lot
.
This
is
because
the
heat
and
light
from
the
sun
can
get
into
the
car
,
by
going
through
the
windows
,
but
it
ca
n't
get
back
out
.
This
is
what
the
greenhouse
effect
does
to
the
earth
.
The
heat
and
light
can
get
through
the
atmosphere
,
but
it
ca
n't
get
out
.
As
a
result
,
the
temperature
rises
.
 
Sometimes
the
temperature
can
change
in
a
way
that
helps
us
.
The
greenhouse
effect
makes
the
earth
appropriate
for
people
to
live
on
.
Without
the
air
to
hold
some
of
the
sun
's
heat
,
,
the
earth
would
be
freezing
,
or
it
would
be
burning
hot
.
It
would
be
freezing
at
night
because
we
would
not
get
the
sun
's
heat
and
light
.
During
the
day
,
especially
during
the
summer
,
it
would
be
burning
because
the
sun
would
be
up
with
no
atmosphere
to
filter
it
,
so
people
,
plants
,
and
animals
would
be
exposed
to
all
the
light
and
heat
.
 
Although
the
greenhouse
effect
makes
the
earth
able
to
have
people
living
on
it
,
if
there
gets
to
be
too
many
gases
,
the
each
can
get
unusually
warmer
,
and
many
plants
,
animals.and
people
will
die
.
Plants
would
die
because
they
would
not
be
able
to
take
the
heat
.
This
would
cause
us
to
have
less
food
to
eat
,
and
it
would
also
limit
the
food
that
animals
have
.
With
less
food
for
the
animals
that
we
need
to
survive
we
would
even
have
less
food
.
Gradually
,
people
,
plants
,
and
animals
would
all
die
of
hunger
.
 
People
are
doing
many
things
to
try
to
stop
global
warming
.
One
thing
is
carpooling
--
driving
with
someone
to
a
place
that
you
are
both
going
to
.
Another
thing
is
being
more
careful
about
leaving
electrical
devices
turned
on
.
Now
,
more
people
are
even
riding
buses
or
bikes
to
lower
the
amount
of
greenhouse
gases
in
the
air
.
Although
adults
do
many
things
to
help
stop
global
warming
,
kids
call
do
just
as
much

"Confidence
is
very
important
in
daily
life
.
It
can
help
you
to
develop
a
healthy
attitude
.
A
study
shows
that
the
people
who
are
more
confident
are
much
happier
.
They
can
have
more
chances
to
make
themselves
successful
.
But
how
to
be
more
confident
.
Here
are
some
suggestions
:
 
Speak
loudly
When
you
are
not
confident
,
you
ca
n't
do
well
what
you
want
to
do
.
You
speak
in
a
voice
so
low
that
other
people
can
hear
you
.
Try
to
speak
aloud
enough
so
that
people
can
hear
you
clearly
.
The
high
voice
can
help
you
become
more
confident
.
 
Play
sports
Physical
exercise
makes
you
tired
but
completely
relaxed
.
When
you
are
athletic
,
you
will
be
full
of
confidence
.
 
Encourage
yourself
Write
down
a
list
of
things
you
did
during
the
day
and
see
how
many
things
you
have
done
well
.
Did
you
finish
your
homework
?
Did
you
tell
a
joke
that
made
everybody
laugh
?
Give
yourself
praise
for
the
good
things
you
've
done
.
 
Get
rid
of
fear
Fear
comes
along
with
failure
.
But
it
's
easy
to
get
over
if
you
know
that
failure
is
a
part
of
your
life
.
Do
n't
hide
your
head
just
because
you
said
something
foolish
last
time
.
Try
to
start
again
and
believe
you
can
do
better
.
 
Pick
up
a
hobby
If
you
like
singing
,
singing
as
much
as
you
can
.
In
some
ways
,
a
hobby
can
make
you
outstanding
.
And
it
will
make
you
happy
and
confident
."	"1

"Have
you
ever
wanted
to
achieve
a
goal
and
ended
up
doing
tons
of
research
on
how
to
achieve
the
goal
?
As
you
learn
more
and
more
,
it
feels
like
you
know
less
and
less
because
when
you
learn
something
new
,
you
find
that
there
is
a
lot
to
know
about
those
things
.
 
Sometimes
,
people
will
get
stuck
in
this
needing
to
gather
more
and
more
information
.
There
's
nothing
wrong
with
learning
a
lot
,
but
when
you
let
learning
get
in
the
way
of
doing
,
you
will
never
get
going
.
When
you
never
get
going
,
you
still
never
start
having
the
things
you
want
.
Too
much
learning
can
paralyze
you
in
terms
of
taking
action
.
 
A
better
way
to
go
about
achieving
a
goal
is
to
gather
some
information
and
immediately
start
taking
action
on
the
information
you
have
gathered
.
Many
times
you
will
feel
unprepared
,
and
that
's
OK
.
The
best
way
to
learn
is
to
take
action
and
learn
from
the
results
you
get
from
those
actions
.
 
When
you
are
able
to
get
past
the
fear
of
not
being
perfect
and
just
take
the
first
step
,
you
will
be
further
ahead
than
the
majority
of
people
who
are
still
in
the
preparation
stage
.
It
's
good
to
be
prepared
especially
in
situations
such
as
a
pilot
and
crew
making
sure
the
plane
is
ready
to
take
off
,
but
over-preparation
in
trying
to
reach
a
goal
wo
n't
give
you
any
results
.
The
knowledge
and
skills
you
will
need
will
be
picked
up
along
the
way
.
 
If
a
baby
wants
to
learn
how
to
walk
,
it
will
never
be
able
to
do
it
by
sitting
there
and
analyzing
how
to
walk
.
The
best
way
for
a
baby
to
walk
is
to
actually
stand
up
and
start
walking
.
Sure
it
may
fall
,
but
with
every
fall
,
it
will
learn
what
is
working
and
what
is
not
and
adjust
to
it
.
By
doing
this
over
and
over
again
,
it
will
eventually
learn
to
walk
.
This
is
the
approach
you
need
to
take
when
you
want
to
achieve
your
goals
as
well
.
It
works
.
Learning
more
is
great
but
if
all
you
're
doing
is
learning
and
not
taking
action
,
it
's
time
to
change
.
Just
take
the
first
step
!"	"417

"As
I
was
reading
a
recent
story
in
Slate
on
20-somethings
complaining
about
how
the
economy
was
ruining
their
life
plans
,
I
could
n't
help
but
think
the
20-somethings
sounded
like
a
bunch
of
spoiled
children
who
grew
up
expecting
everything
to
be
easy
for
them
.
As
a
20-something
myself
,
I
certainly
share
their
disappointment
:
my
husband
and
I
probably
wo
n't
be
able
to
buy
a
house
until
we
're
in
our
40s
,
and
we
too
are
burdened
by
student
loans
.
But
why
should
it
be
any
different
?
Being
young
persons
in
America
,
should
n't
they
take
up
all
of
the
challenges
and
opportunities
that
this
country
offers
?
 
Consider
some
of
these
views
shared
in
the
Slate
story
:
Jennifer
,
29
,
owner
of
a
two-bedroom
apartment
with
her
husband
,
worries
that
she
wo
n't
be
able
to
have
children
for
at
least
a
decade
because
they
ca
n't
afford
to
buy
a
house
yet
.
 
I
read
that
,
and
I
thought
,
what
planet
is
she
living
on
where
you
need
to
own
a
house
in
order
to
have
kids
?
Has
she
ever
visited
a
developing
country
,
or
even
downtown
areas
in
this
one
?
Home
ownership
is
a
luxury
,
not
a
fertility
requirement
.
 
A
26-year-old
in
the
story
despairs
that
he
ca
n't
afford
to
get
a
Ph
.
D.
in
literature
.
Well
,
that
sounds
a
bit
like
expressing
disappointment
that
no
one
will
pay
you
to
write
poetry
on
the
beach
in
Thailand
for
five
years
.
 
Yes
,
it
's
sad
that
these
young
people
feel
so
lost
.
But
I
think
the
problem
is
their
extremely
high
expectations
,
not
economic
reality
.
Beth
Kobliner
,
author
of
Get
a
Financial
Life
:
Personal
Finance
in
Your
Twenties
and
Thirties
,
says
that
she
thinks
people
's
expectations
are
slowly
adjusting
,
but
today
's
20-somethings
grew
up
at
a
time
when
everyone
's
wealth
appeared
to
be
expanding
.
Their
parents
probably
saw
their
home
values
rise
along
with
their
investments
.
""
So
you
have
people
who
have
grown
up
in
an
environment
where
people
had
great
expectations
of
what
living
well
means
,
""
says
Kobliner
.
 
This
recession
will
certainly
play
a
role
in
forcing
those
expectations
into
more
realistic
group
.
In
the
meantime
,
it
seems
a
lot
better
for
our
mental
health
to
focus
on
being
grateful-for
our
one-bedroom
apartments
,
for
living
in
modern
cities
,
or
perhaps
just
for
being
able
to
eat
three
meals
a
day-than
on
longing
for
some
kind
of
luxury
life

"As
part
of
an
effort
to
improve
treatments
for
life-threatening
illnesses
,
a
team
of
scientists
have
created
rabbits
that
glow
in
the
dark
.
 
The
efforts
have
produced
two
rabbits
out
of
a
litter
of
eight
that
went
from
being
a
normal
,
soft
white
to
glowing
green
in
the
dark
.
The
rabbits
were
born
at
the
University
of
Istanbul
as
part
of
the
cooperation
between
scientists
from
universities
in
Turkey
and
Hawaii
.
 
The
rabbits
glow
to
show
that
a
genetic
operation
technique
can
work
efficiently
.
""
The
green
is
not
important
at
all
--
it
's
just
a
marker
to
show
the
experiment
can
be
done
successfully
,
""
said
University
of
Hawaii
associate
professor
,
Stefan
Moisyadi
.
 
To
produce
the
glowing
effect
,
researchers
injected
jellyfish
DNA
into
a
mother
rabbit
's
embryos
.
Then
those
embryos
were
put
into
the
mother
.
Similar
experiments
have
resulted
in
glowing
cockroaches
and
cats
.
 
Eventually
,
the
researchers
hope
the
technique
can
lead
to
new
ways
to
produce
medicines
,
Moisyadi
said
.
 
""
The
final
goal
is
to
develop
animals
that
are
able
to
produce
beneficial
molecules
in
their
milk
that
can
be
cheaply
extracted
,
especially
in
countries
that
can
not
afford
big
factories
that
make
drugs
,
which
usually
cost
US
$
1bn
to
build
.
Then
they
will
be
able
to
produce
their
own
protein-based
medication
in
animals
,
""
Moisyadi
said
.
 
The
rabbits
are
expected
to
live
as
long
as
non-glowing
rabbits
,
but
Moisyadi
said
he
understands
people
can
object
to
this
kind
of
experimentation
involving
live
animals
.
""
To
the
people
against
,
I
say
:
think
,
what
are
the
benefits
and
what
is
the
harm
?
""
Moisyadi
said
.
""
And
if
the
benefits
outweigh
the
harm
,
let
's
go
with
the
benefits
.
""
 
Moisyadi
started
developing
the
project
in
2006
,
and
researchers
are
now
waiting
to
see
if
pregnant
sheep
produce
similar
results

A

a
round
piece

You

oval
shape

You

A

Would

Can

It

There

one
sure

They
eat

they

"Some
years
ago
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
south
Florida
a
little
boy
decided
to
go
for
a
swim
in
the
old
swimming
hole
behind
his
house
.
In
a
hurry
to
dive
into
the
cool
water
,
he
ran
out
of
the
back
door
,
leaving
behind
shoes
,
socks
,
and
shirt
as
he
went
.
 
He
flew
into
the
water
,
not
realizing
that
as
he
swam
toward
the
middle
of
the
lake
,
a
crocodile
was
swimming
toward
him
.
His
mother
in
the
house
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
two
.
In
great
fear
,
she
ran
toward
the
water
,
shouting
to
her
son
as
loudly
as
she
could
.
Hearing
her
voice
,
the
little
boy
became
alarmed
and
made
a
U-turn
to
swim
to
his
mother
.
It
was
too
late
.
Just
as
he
reached
her
,
the
crocodile
reached
him
.
From
the
shore
,
the
mother
grabbed
her
little
boy
by
the
arms
just
as
the
crocodile
snatched
his
legs
.
That
began
an
incredible
tug-of-war
between
the
two
.
The
crocodile
was
much
stronger
than
the
mother
,
but
the
mother
was
much
too
passionate
to
let
go
.
A
farmer
happened
to
drive
by
,
heard
their
screams
,
raced
from
his
truck
,
took
aim
and
shot
the
crocodile
.
 
Remarkably
,
after
weeks
and
weeks
in
the
hospital
,
the
little
boy
survived
.
His
legs
were
extremely
scarred
by
the
attack
of
the
animal
.
And
,
on
his
arms
,
were
deep
scratches
where
his
mother
's
fingernails
dug
into
his
flesh
in
her
effort
to
hang
on
to
the
son
she
loved
.
 
The
newspaper
reporter
,
who
interviewed
the
boy
,
asked
if
he
would
show
him
his
scars
.
The
boy
lifted
his
legs
.
And
then
,
with
obvious
pride
,
he
said
to
the
reporter
,
""
But
look
at
my
arms
.
I
have
great
scars
on
my
arms
,
too
.
I
have
them
because
my
Mom
would
n't
let
go
.
""
 
Never
judge
another
person
's
scars
,
because
you
do
n't
know
how
they
were
made

"Talk
about
a
real-life
hero
!
Ten-year-old
Larry
Champagne
from
St.
Louis
,
Missouri
,
hit
the
brake
on
a
runaway
school
bus
.
He
saved
himself
and
20
other
kids
on
board
from
disaster
.
 
It
all
happened
in
one
terrible
accident
.
On
the
way
to
school
,
the
bus
driver
,
Ernestine
Blackman
,
suddenly
fell
ill
.
Seeing
the
car
was
running
away
,
the
other
kids
started
to
scream
,
but
Larry
ran
to
the
front
and
stopped
the
bus
.
 
""
At
first
I
thought
,
'We
're
going
to
die
,
'
""
says
Larry
,
""
but
after
I
pressed
the
brake
,
I
felt
safe
.
""
 
Larry
's
speedy
reaction
made
news
all
over
the
country
.
He
appeared
on
TV
shows
as
a
hero
.
The
bus
company
gave
Larry
a
big
gift
.
His
school
hung
a
medal
of
honor
around
his
neck
.
 
""
My
grandmother
always
tells
me
to
do
what
's
right
,
""
says
Larry
.
He
thanked
his
brother
,
Jerrick
,
9
,
who
""
helped
me
get
the
bus
driver
up
""
during
the
emergency
.
How
did
he
know
how
to
stop
the
bus
?
Larry
is
something
of
a
mechanic
.
He
helps
his
grandfather
work
on
his
old
truck
.
""
He
gets
his
hands
dirty
,
""
says
his
grandfather
.
One
thing
is
for
certain
:
Larry
knows
where
to
find
the
brakes

"In
terms
of
history
,
Australian
cuisine
was
on
the
basis
of
traditional
British
cooking
brought
to
the
country
by
the
first
settlers
.
Modern
Australian
cuisine
,
however.has
been
heavily
influenced
by
Australia
'
s
Asian
and
Southeast
Asian
neighbors
.
The
trend
,
encouraged
by
long-term
government
health
programs
,
is
towards
low-fat
healthy
cookery
including
low-fat
meat
and
lightly
cooked
,
colorful
,
steamed
or
fried
vegetables
.
Besides,1ike
many
English
families
,
in
many
Australian
homes
,
a
widespread
tradition
of
having
roast
turkey
,
chicken
,
and
ham
for
Christmas
1unch
or
dinner
still
remains
.
 
Generally
breakfast
is
light
in
most
parts
of
Australia.but
in
the
colder
regions
porridge
or
meals
similar
to
the
full
English
breakfast
may
be
consumed
.
In
recent
years
,
however
,
most
Australian
people
prefer
light
breakfast
in
order
to
control
their
weight
.
The
1ight
breakfast
commonly
consists
of
cereals
,
toast
and
fruit
.
A
heavier
breakfast
will
frequently
include
fried
bacon
,
eggs
,
mushrooms
,
etc
.
Drinks
taken
at
breakfast
include
tea
,
coffee
,
milk
or
juice
.
 
The
evening
meal
is
the
main
meal
of
the
day
for
most
Australians
,
and
when
consumed
at
home
,
it
is
often
eaten
with
members
of
the
immediate
family
.
The
dishes
served
will
vary
widely
according
to
the
tastes
and
background
of
the
family
.
A
typical
Australian
restaurant
might
offer
sandwiches
,
chicken
or
other
meat-based
dishes
and
cakes
.
 
In
recent
years
,
take
--
away
food
is
becoming
popular
in
Australia
.
American-style
chain
restaurants
are
common
including
Subway
,
KFC
,
and
Mcdonald
's
.
They
a11
come
from
America
.
Most
of
these
restaurants
sell
high
quality
food
at
reasonable
prices
.
 
With
the
high
1evels
of
immigration
from
the
Middle
East
.
South
and
Southeast
Asia
.
Korea
.
China
and
other
countries
from
a11
over
the
world
to
Australia.many
authentic
and
high-quality
restaurants
are
run
by
first-and
second-generation
immigrants
from
these
areas

"Compared
to
night
owls
,
people
who
rise
early
feel
happier
and
more
satisfied
with
life
overall
.
 
But
the
good
news
for
teenagers
is
that
most
people
become
earlier
risers
as
they
age
,
and
this
change
is
also
associated
with
greater
feelings
of
happiness
.
Researchers
at
the
University
of
Toronto
asked
more
than
700
people
about
their
preferred
time
of
day
and
how
healthy
and
happy
they
generally
feel
.
 
They
then
compared
the
responses
of
the
group
of
younger
adults
aged
17
to
38
with
older
people
ages
59
to
79
.
Only
about
seven
percent
of
young
adults
are
morning
larks
,
while
by
age
60
most
people
preferred
to
be
up
with
the
dawn
.
Just
seven
percent
of
the
oldest
people
in
the
study
described
themselves
as
night
owls
.
 
""
We
found
that
older
adults
reported
greater
positive
emotion
than
younger
adults
,
and
older
adults
were
more
likely
to
be
morning
-
type
people
than
younger
adults
,
""
study
researcher
Renee
Biss
from
the
University
of
Toronto
reportedly
told
LiveScience
.
The
""
morningness
""
was
associated
with
greater
happiness
emotions
in
both
age
groups
.
 
Morning
trypes
also
tended
to
report
that
they
felt
healthier
than
the
late
risers
,
according
to
the
study
that
published
in
the
journal
Emition
.
The
researchers
said
that
this
apparent
health
benefit
could
come
from
the
extra
sleep
they
would
enjoy
,
as
their
sleeping
schedule
would
fit
with
society
's
expectations
of
rising
early
for
work
.
 
This
extra
sleep
could
not
only
make
them
feel
more
clear
-mined
,
but
may
also
boost
their
immune
system
.
 
""
An
evening
person
may
go
throught
their
week
feeling
unhappy
because
they
have
to
get
up
earlier
than
they
would
like
to
""
.
But
Ms
Biss
said
there
was
hope
for
night
owls
as
it
was
possible
for
them
to
turn
themselves
into
morning
people
.
 
""
One
way
to
do
it
is
to
increase
your
natural
light
exposure
early
in
the
morning
,
and
to
wake
up
earlier
and
go
to
bed
earlier
,
""
she
said
.
""
It
's
easiest
if
you
have
a
consistent
schedule
,
to
make
sure
you
are
waking
up
at
the
same
time
every
day

"Everyone
has
got
two
personalities
--
-
the
one
that
is
shown
to
the
world
and
the
other
that
is
secret
and
real
.
You
do
n't
show
your
secret
personality
when
you
're
awake
because
you
can
control
yourself
.
But
when
you
're
asleep
,
your
sleeping
position
shows
the
real
you
.
During
a
normal
night
,
of
course
,
you
often
change
your
sleeping
positions
.
The
important
position
that
best
shows
your
secret
personality
is
the
one
that
you
go
to
sleep
in
.
 
If
you
go
to
sleep
on
your
back
,
you
're
a
very
open
person
.
You
normally
trust
people
and
you
are
easily
influenced
by
new
ideas
.
You
do
n't
like
to
make
people
unhappy
,
so
you
never
express
your
real
feelings
.
And
you
also
like
to
share
your
secrets
with
your
friends
.
But
you
are
n't
very
confident
.
 
If
you
sleep
on
your
stomach
,
you
are
a
person
who
likes
to
keep
secrets
.
You
worry
a
lot
and
you
always
easily
become
sad

"It
has
been
argued
that
an
infant
under
three
who
is
cared
for
outside
the
home
may
suffer
because
of
the
separation
from
his
parents
.
The
British
psychoanalyst
John
Bowlby
believes
that
separation
from
the
parents
during
the
sensitive
""
attachment
""
period
from
birth
to
three
may
scar
a
child
's
personality
and
incline
to
emotional
problems
in
later
life
.
Some
people
have
drawn
the
conclusion
from
Bowlby
's
work
that
children
should
not
be
sent
to
day
care
before
the
age
of
three
,
and
many
people
do
believe
this
.
But
there
are
also
arguments
against
such
a
strong
conclusion
.
 
Firstly
,
anthropologists
point
out
that
the
hidden
love
between
children
and
parents
found
in
modem
societies
does
not
usually
exist
in
traditional
societies
.
For
example
,
we
saw
earlier
that
among
the
Ngonis
the
father
and
mother
of
a
child
did
not
raise
their
infant
alone
.
But
traditional
societies
are
so
different
from
modern
societies
that
comparisons
based
on
just
one
factor
are
hard
to
understand
.
 
Secondly
,
common
sense
tells
us
that
day
care
would
not
be
so
widespread
today
if
parents
and
caretakers
found
that
children
had
problems
with
it
.
But
Bowlby
's
analysis
raises
the
possibility
that
early
day
care
has
delayed
effects
.
The
possibility
that
such
care
might
lead
to
more
mental
illness
or
crime
15
or
20
years
later
can
only
be
noticed
by
the
use
of
statistics
.
Statistical
studies
of
this
kind
have
not
yet
been
carried
out
,
and
even
if
they
were
,
the
results
would
be
certain
to
be
complicated
and
controversial
.
 
Thirdly
,
in
the
last
decade
,
there
have
been
a
number
of
careful
American
studies
of
children
in
day
care
,
and
they
have
reported
that
day
care
had
a
neutral
of
slightly
positive
effect
on
children
's
development
.
But
tests
that
have
had
to
be
used
to
measure
this
development
are
not
widely
enough
accepted
to
settle
the
issue

"A
long
time
before
I
was
born
,
my
grandma
and
grandpa
had
a
young
family
of
four
little
girls
.
During
the
Great
Depression
,
work
was
hard
to
find
,
so
Grandpa
did
whatever
jobs
he
could
.
On
weekends
he
and
Grandma
dug
a
garden
to
grow
some
of
their
own
food
.
 
Everybody
worked
to
keep
the
garden
growing
.
All
summer
long
,
the
family
ate
food
and
enjoyed
flowers
from
the
garden
.
Grandma
put
up
strawberry
jam
,
tomatoes
,
beans
,
peppers
,
pears
and
peaches
in
canning
jars
.
They
were
good
to
eat
through
the
long
winter
.
 
The
family
grew
up
,
and
grandparents
grew
old
.
It
became
hard
to
keep
up
the
garden
,
so
they
made
it
a
little
smaller
.
There
was
still
plenty
to
eat
from
the
garden
and
lovely
flowers
to
enjoy
.
 
Then
one
summer
when
Grandpa
was
eighty-nine
years
old
,
all
he
could
do
was
watch
from
his
lawn
chair
as
the
vegetables
grew
and
the
roses
bloomed
.
Summer
slowly
faded
,
and
Grandpa
died
before
it
was
time
to
bring
in
the
harvest
.
 
It
was
a
lonely
winter
for
Grandma
.
She
sat
near
the
window
,
looking
out
at
the
yard
and
wondering
if
she
could
plant
a
garden
in
the
spring
.
When
spring
came
,
she
planted
only
a
little
garden
.
 
One
sunny
day
in
the
early
summer
,
Grandma
heard
a
commotion
in
the
front
yard
and
looked
out
the
window
to
see
a
frightening
sight
.
A
huge
swarm
of
bees
filled
the
air
between
two
tall
trees
.
The
buzzing
sound
was
very
loud
.
 
The
bees
made
their
way
into
a
hole
up
in
one
of
the
trees
.
Before
long
,
every
one
of
those
bees
had
disappeared
into
its
new
home
.
During
the
next
few
days
,
the
bees
were
busy
minding
their
own
business
.
Grandma
could
always
see
a
few
bees
buzzing
in
and
out
around
the
opening
high
in
the
tree
.
Before
long
,
she
decided
the
bees
were
n't
bothering
anyone
,
so
she
did
n't
give
them
another
thought
.
 
That
summer
,
Grandma
's
little
garden
grew
and
grew
.
_
 
One
day
,
Grandma
's
brother
Frank
visited
from
Arizona
.
As
Grandma
made
Frank
a
delicious
lunch
of
squash
cakes
and
homemade
applesauce
,
she
told
him
the
story
about
the
swarm
of
bees
.
Frank
said
,
""
In
Arizona
,
the
farmers
often
hired
beekeepers
to
set
up
beehives
near
their
fields
.
The
bees
pollinated
the
crops
and
helped
them
to
grow
.
""
 
That
was
when
Grandma
realized
that
her
bees
had
helped
with
her
garden
all
summer
.
""
So
that
's
why
my
little
garden
had
such
a
big
crop
!
""
she
exclaimed
.
 
From
that
time
on
,
Grandma
always
believed
that
since
Grandpa
could
n't
be
there
to
help
her
that
summer
,
he
had
sent
the
bees
to
take
his
place
and
make
Grandma
's
little
garden
grow
and
grow
."	"1

"The
porter
brings
your
bags
to
your
room
and
helpfully
explains
all
you
want
to
know
.
Then
he
points
to
the
phone
and
says
,
""
If
there
's
anything
else
you
need
,
just
call
.
""
All
this
time
you
have
been
thinking
one
thing
,
""
How
much
should
I
tip
him
?
""
To
make
your
next
trip
a
little
easier
,
here
's
a
guide
to
tipping
across
some
Asian
countries
.
 
Bangkok
 
In
general
,
the
more
Westernized
the
place
is
,
the
more
likely
you
will
be
expected
to
leave
a
tip
.
Some
top-end
restaurants
will
add
a
10
%
service
charge
to
the
bill
.
If
not
,
waiters
will
appreciate
you
tacking
on
the
10
%
yourself
.
However
,
if
you
're
eating
at
a
lower-end
restaurant
a
tip
is
not
necessary
.
If
you
're
staying
at
one
of
Bangkok
's
many
five-star
hotels
,
expect
to
tip
the
porter
20
to
50
baht
,
depending
on
how
many
bags
you
have
.
Taxis
are
now
metered
in
Bangkok
.
Local
custom
is
to
round
the
fare
up
to
the
nearest
five
baht
.
 
Hong
Kong
 
Tipping
is
customary
in
this
money-mad
metropolis
.
Most
restaurants
add
a
10
%
service
charge
to
the
bill
,
but
the
extra
money
often
ends
up
in
the
pocket
of
the
owner
.
If
the
service
is
good
,
add
another
10
%
to
the
bill
,
up
to
HK
$
100
in
an
especially
nice
restaurant
.
For
HK
$
10
hotel
porters
should
do
it
at
all
but
the
nicest
hotels
where
a
new
HK
$
20
bill
may
be
more
acceptable
.
When
in
a
taxi
,
round
up
to
the
nearest
dollar
.
 
Kuala
Lumpur
 
Tipping
in
Malaysia
is
limited
to
the
expensive
Westernized
hotels
,
which
often
add
a
10
%
service
charge
to
your
meal
or
hotel
room
.
If
you
are
at
a
hotel
restaurant
,
expect
a
10
%
service
charge
.
But
at
local
restaurants
,
there
's
no
need
to
add
a
tip
.
At
five-star
hotels
,
one
or
two
ringgit
will
content
a
porter
.
At
lower-end
buildings
do
n't
feel
you
have
to
tip
.
Like
Bangkok
,
many
taxis
are
now
metered
so
you
can
just
round
up
to
the
nearest
ringgit
.
 
Seoul
 
Tipping
is
not
part
of
Korean
culture
,
although
it
has
become
a
matter
of
course
in
international
hotels
where
a
10
%
service
charge
is
often
added
.
If
you
're
at
a
Korean
barbecue
joint
,
there
's
no
need
to
add
anything
extra
.
But
a
nice
Italian
restaurant
may
require
a
10
%
contribution
.
If
you
're
at
a
top-end
hotel
,
so
expect
to
pay
500~1
000
won
per
bag
.
Taxi
drivers
do
n't
accept
a
tip
.
Keep
the
change
for
yourself

No
man
is
an
island
""
is
a
well-known
line
from
John
Donne
's
Devotion
.
It
was
written
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
.
Even
now
people
still
agree
with
him
.
No
one
can
live
a
completely
lonely
life
.
Without
other
people
,
life
will
become
empty
and
sad
.
We
all
need
to
have
friends
.
 
For
some
of
us
,
although
making
friends
is
not
difficult
,
feeling
shy
,
we
may
not
want
to
make
the
first
move
.
It
is
also
difficult
at
times
to
keep
the
friends
we
already
have
.
 
There
are
many
books
about
friendship
,
but
Dale
Carnegie
's
How
to
Win
Friends
and
Influence
People
,
written
in
1936
,
is
the
most
famous
.
This
""
how
to
""
book
about
getting
along
with
other
people
became
a
best
seller
.
It
was
later
put
into
28
languages
.
 
Dale
Carnegie
's
advice
seems
to
be
simple
,
but
can
his
advice
help
you
?
Do
you
need
to
change
the
way
you
act
?
Here
is
the
list
of
advice
from
his
book
:
 
Be
friendly
and
polite
.
 
Always
greet
with
a
smile
.
Begin
with
""
Excuse
me
""
or
""
Would
you
please
""
when
you
want
to
ask
somebody
.
Remember
to
say
""
Thank
you
""
and
try
to
be
as
helpful
as
you
can
.
 
Go
out
of
your
way
to
be
nice
.
 
Find
some
time
to
do
special
things
for
other
people
.
Making
some
soup
for
a
sick
neighbour
may
seem
like
a
little
thing
to
you
,
but
it
will
make
your
neighbor
feel
a
lot
better
.
 
Remember
names
.
 
They
say
that
the
sweetest
music
to
a
person
's
ears
is
the
sound
of
his
or
her
own
name
.
 
Be
open-minded
.
 
Try
to
understand
other
people
's
ways
and
ideas
and
learn
something
from
them
.
 
Listen
patiently
.
 
When
someone
is
talking
to
you
,
look
at
him
or
her
,
listen
carefully
and
say
something
when
necessary

very
much

from

So
on
Saturday

they
stay

watch
TV
from
morning

night
.
They
do
n't

Usually
children
like
to
eat

meat

They
do
n't

They
do

At

,
the
children
only
do
a

never

The

We

We

"Suppose
you
do
n't
need
your
car
today
.
And
suppose
,
as
it
happens
that
a
stranger
in
your
area
does
need
a
car
.
Would
you
be
willing
to
rent
yours
out
?
 
Several
carsharing
startups
,
including
Getaround
,
RelayRides
and
JustSharelt
,
are
eager
to
connect
car
owners
with
renters
this
way
.
The
companies
have
different
rules
,
but
participating
owners
receive
,
generally
speaking
,
about
twothirds
of
the
rental
earnings
.
RelayRides
says
an
owner
of
a
midsize
,
latemodel
sedan
who
rents
out
a
car
for
10
hours
a
week
could
expect
to
clear
about
$
3,000
a
year
.
 
Peertopeer
carsharing
remains
in
the
trial
stage
;
it
can
be
found
in
San
Francisco
and
a
few
other
places
.
It
has
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
becomes
the
auto
equivalent
of
Airbnb
,
the
surprise
success
story
for
peertopeer
sharing
of
space
in
apartments
and
houses
.
 
Shelby
Clark
,
founder
of
RelayRides
,
says
potential
investors
in
his
company
have
been
concerned
that
owners
will
be
afraid
to
hand
their
car
over
to
strangers
.
To
address
that
,
he
points
to
Airbnb
,
saying
,
""
Letting
people
sleep
in
your
living
room
is
much
more
of
a
disturbance
into
your
personal
space
than
letting
someone
use
your
car
.
""
 
All
of
these
companies
offer
their
own
insurance
coverage
for
their
renters
,
which
are
supposed
to
put
owners
'
minds
at
ease
.
But
only
two
states
--
California
and
Oregon
--
have
passed
laws
to
clarify
that
an
owner
will
not
suffer
any
consequences
should
a
carsharing
renter
have
an
accident
.
 
""
In
all
the
other
states
,
legal
ambiguity
remains
,
""
Shelby
Clark
says
.
""
If
a
renter
should
be
involved
in
a
serious
accident
in
those
states
,
the
victim
can
be
expected
to
go
after
every
party
possible
,
including
the
car
's
owner
.
""
 
Also
to
remove
the
worries
of
car
owners
,
the
driving
records
of
renters
are
checked
for
recent
serious
violations.."	"355

"Erik
Weihenmayer
was
born
with
an
eye
disorder
.
As
a
child
his
eyesight
became
worse
and
then
,
at
the
age
of
13
,
he
lost
his
sight
completely
.
However
,
he
did
not
lose
his
determination
to
lead
a
full
and
active
life
.
 
Erik
became
an
adventurer
.
He
took
up
parachuting
,
wrestling
and
scuba
diving
.
He
competed
in
long-distance
biking
,
marathons
and
skiing
.
His
favorite
sport
,
thought
,
is
mountaineering
.
 
As
a
young
man
,
Erik
started
to
climb
mountains
.
He
reached
the
summit
of
Mount
McKinley
in
1995
and
then
climbed
the
dangerous
1000-metre
rock
wall
of
EI
Capitan
.
Two
years
later
,
while
climbing
Mount
Kilimanjaro
in
Kenya
with
his
girlfriend
,
they
stopped
for
a
time
at
13,000
feet
above
sea
level-in
order
to
get
married
.
In
1999
,
he
climbed
Aconcagua
,
the
tallest
mountain
in
South
America
.
And
then
,
on
May
25
,
2001
,
at
the
age
of
33
,
Erik
successfully
completed
the
greatest
mountaineering
challenge
of
all
.
He
climbed
Mount
Everest
,
the
highest
mountain
in
the
world
.
 
Erik
invented
his
own
method
for
climbing
mountains
.
He
carries
two
long
poles
:
one
to
lean
on
and
the
other
to
test
the
way
ahead
of
him
.
The
climber
in
front
of
him
wears
a
bell
to
guide
him
.
Erik
is
a
good
team
member
.
He
does
his
share
of
the
job
,
such
as
setting
up
tents
and
building
snow
walls
.
 
Although
he
could
not
enjoy
the
view
,
Erik
felt
the
excitement
of
being
on
the
summit
of
Everest
.
He
hopes
that
his
success
will
change
how
people
think
about
the
blind
.
""
When
people
think
about
a
blind
person
or
blindness
,
now
they
will
think
about
a
person
standing
on
top
of
the
world
.

"""
Now
I
just
do
n't
believe
that
.
""
Surely
all
of
us
,
at
some
point
,
have
watched
a
movie
and
thought
:
It
's
simply
badly
researched
,
or
,
the
makers
must
think
we
're
fools
.
 
If
movies
were
completely
scientifically
accurate
,
they
'd
probably
be
as
interesting
as
a
Physics
101
lecture
.
In
real
life
,
there
are
no
explosions
in
space
,
gas
usually
does
n't
explode
from
a
lit
cigarette
,
and
Bruce
Willis
/
Jackie
Chan
/
Will
Smith
would
most
likely
be
in
a
coma
after
getting
kicked
in
the
head
.
 
Recently
,
the
British
newspaper
The
Daily
Telegraph
ran
a
humorous
piece
on
unconvincing
tech
moments
from
some
top
movies
.
Let
's
see
what
they
are
all
about
.
 
Telegraph
writer
Tom
Chivers
'
first
example
is
from
the
end-of-the-world
movie
Independence
Day
,
in
which
a
character
comes
up
with
a
virus
capable
of
destroying
Windows
,
the
computer
system
the
alien
spacecraft
uses
.
""
It
's
a
good
thing
they
did
n't
have
Norton
antivirus
,
""
jokes
Chivers
.
 
It
's
just
one
case
of
a
movie
that
takes
a
lot
of
license
with
its
science
.
Another
one
Chivers
mentions
is
from
Star
Wars
,
where
glowing
beams
of
light
traveling
through
space
look
very
impressive
.
The
problem
is
that
in
space
there
are
no
air
particles
for
the
light
to
reflect
off
.
In
reality
,
they
'd
not
be
seen
,
which
would
n't
look
so
cool
on
the
big
screen
.
 
Chivers
'
second
piece
of
Star
Wars
nonsense
is
the
sound
the
fighters
make
in
the
movies
:
""
the
bellow
of
an
elephant
mixed
with
a
car
driving
on
a
wet
road
""
.
But
sound
needs
a
medium
to
travel
through
,
like
air
.
In
space
,
there
would
n't
actually
be
any
sound
at
all
.
 
Few
people
would
deny
that
the
mind-bending
Matrix
films
make
for
great
viewing
,
but
for
Chivers
,
the
science
in
the
movies
is
a
little
silly
.
 
And
finally
:
as
Chivers
points
out
,
DAN
is
not
replaceable
.
But
this
bit
of
elementary
genetics
passed
the
makers
of
the
2002
Bond
film
Die
another
Day
by
.
In
the
film
the
villain
has
""
gene
therapy
""
to
change
his
appearance
and
his
DNA
,
which
is
completely
impossible

"Jogging
has
become
the
most
popular
individual
sport
in
America
.
Many
theories
,
even
some
mystical
ones
,
have
been
advanced
to
explain
the
popularity
of
jogging
.
The
plain
truth
is
that
jogging
is
a
cheap
,
quick
and
efficient
way
to
maintain
(
or
achieve
)
physical
fitness
.
 
The
most
useful
sort
of
exercise
is
exercise
that
develops
the
heart
,
lungs
,
and
circulatory
systems
.
If
these
systems
are
fit
,
the
body
is
ready
for
almost
any
sport
and
for
almost
any
sudden
demand
made
by
work
or
emergencies
.
One
can
train
more
specifically
,
as
by
developing
strength
for
weight
lifting
or
the
ability
to
run
straight
ahead
for
short
distances
with
great
power
as
in
football
,
but
running
trains
your
heart
and
lungs
to
deliver
oxygen
more
efficiently
to
all
parts
of
your
body
.
It
is
worth
doing
that
:
this
sort
of
exercise
is
the
only
kind
that
can
reduce
heart
disease
,
the
number
one
cause
of
death
in
America
.
 
Only
one
sort
of
equipment
is
needed
--
a
pair
of
good
shoes
.
Physicians
advise
beginning
joggers
not
to
try
to
run
in
tennis
or
gym
shoes
.
Many
design
advances
have
been
made
in
only
the
last
several
years
that
make
a
pair
of
excellent
running
shoes
indispensable
if
a
runner
wishes
to
develop
as
quickly
as
possible
,
with
as
little
chance
of
injury
as
possible
.
A
pair
of
good
running
shoes
will
have
soft
pads
for
absorbing
shock
,
as
well
as
slightly
built-up
heels
and
full
heel
cups
that
will
give
the
knee
and
ankle
more
stability
.
A
wise
investment
in
good
shoes
will
prevent
blisters
and
the
foot
,
ankle
and
knee
injuries
and
will
also
enable
the
wearer
to
run
on
paved
or
soft
surfaces
.
No
other
special
equipment
is
needed
;
you
can
jog
in
any
clothing
you
desire
,
even
your
street
clothes
.
 
It
takes
surprisingly
little
time
to
develop
the
ability
to
run
.
The
American
Jogging
Association
has
a
twelve-week
program
designed
to
move
from
a
fifteen-
minute
walk
(
which
almost
anyone
can
manage
who
is
in
reasonable
health
)
to
a
thirty-minute
run
.
A
measure
of
common
sense
,
a
physical
examination
,
and
a
planned
schedule
are
all
it
takes

"A
Russian

an
American

were
on

The

took
out
a

of
vodka
,
gave
each
of
the
men
a
drink
and
then
threw
the
rest
half
bottle
of
vodka
out

There
's

much
vodka

Russian
,
""
And
really
we
have
more
than
we
will
ever
use

A
little
later
,
the
Cuban
passed
around
fine
Havana
Cigars
.
Then
he
threw
his
out
of
the
window
.
 
""
I
thought
Cuba
is
not

the

said

""
But
you
threw
that
very
good
cigars
out

""
Cigars
,
""
the
Cuban
answered
,
""
are
the
cheapest
in
my

.
We
have
more
of
them
than
we
know
what
to
do
with

The
American
businessman
sat
quietly
for
a
moment
.
Then
he
got
up
,
caught
the
lawyer
by
the
arm
and
threw
him
out
of
the
window

"Dear
Aunt
Tara
,
 
I
have
a
problem
with
my
homework
.
We
have
to
do
it
in
a
group
.
It
has
to
be
finished
this
Friday
,
but
Gary
,
the
boy
in
our
group
,
has
done
nothing
helpful
.
He
just
keeps
rocking
the
boat
.
 
Every
time
we
talk
about
the
work
with
him
,
he
always
says
,
""
Do
n't
worry
.
I
'll
do
it
later
.
""
But
he
seldom
does
his
job
.
And
when
he
does
,
he
does
it
the
wrong
way
.
Someone
has
to
do
it
for
him
again
.
What
's
worse
is
when
Ms.
Lin
asks
about
our
group
,
Gary
always
tells
her
that
we
others
do
n't
work
hard
enough
.
I
'm
really
mad
at
Gary
about
this
.
We
're
in
the
same
group
.
Should
n't
we
help
each
other
to
do
a
better
job
?
 
Kate
 
Dear
Kate
,
 
It
is
important
for
students
to
learn
how
to
work
together
in
a
group
.
Maybe
you
should
talk
to
Gary
about
the
problem
and
tell
him
you
all
need
his
help
.
If
he
still
does
n't
change
,
go
talk
to
your
teacher
.
I
believe
she
can
make
Gary
do
his
job
.

"One
warm
September
night
,
Mira
had
come
down
to
the
beach
to
enjoy
the
night
air
.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
listened
to
the
waves
.
Suddenly
,
she
could
hear
another
sound
,
so
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
down
at
the
sand
.
It
was
moving
!
All
of
a
sudden
she
could
see
a
tiny
head
coming
out
.
Then
a
turtle
appeared
!
One
by
one
they
struggled
out
of
their
underground
nests
.
Mira
looked
in
surprise
at
the
baby
turtles
.
 
Mira
knew
the
turtles
should
head
towards
the
waves
and
swim
away
,
so
she
was
puzzled
when
they
began
to
pull
themselves
towards
the
dunes
.
Suddenly
,
she
remembered
something
her
grandmother
had
told
her
.
 
""
Sea
turtles
bury
their
eggs
on
the
beach
every
year
in
April
and
in
September
.
Those
baby
turtles
hatch
and
head
back
down
to
the
sea
.
But
some
of
them
never
make
it
.
Sometimes
they
die
going
across
the
dunes
,
trying
to
find
those
bright
lights
on
the
houses
.
Every
day
there
are
more
houses
being
built
on
the
dunes
.
That
means
more
and
more
lights
to
confuse
the
sea
turtles
.
""
 
Mira
looked
out
across
the
dunes
at
her
house
.
Mira
saw
her
mother
and
father
,
sitting
on
the
porch
.
She
could
see
them
because
her
house
had
two
bright
lights
that
lit
up
the
porch
.
 
Mira
began
to
run
to
her
house
and
shouted
,
""
The
turtles
are
hatching
!
We
have
to
help
the
turtles
!
""
With
these
words
,
Mira
ran
into
the
house
and
turned
off
the
bright
porch
lights
.
 
In
a
rush
she
was
off
running
down
the
dunes
with
her
whole
family
following
her
.
They
reached
the
beach
just
in
time
to
see
the
tiny
turtles
slipping
silently
into
the
waves
.
Mira
watched
as
the
last
turtle
entered
the
water
.
As
the
turtle
swam
away
,
it
looked
back
at
Mira
.
In
the
moonlight
,
Mira
thought
she
saw
it
smile

"The
first
reality
TV
show
in
the
world
was
called
Expedition
Robinson
and
it
was
shown
in
Sweden
in
1997
.
Half
the
population
of
the
country
watched
the
final
event
and
a
new
kind
of
TV
program
was
born
.
Two
years
later
in
Holland
,
the
first
series
of
Big
Brother
was
filmed
.
Again
,
it
was
a
great
success
and
the
final
program
was
watched
by
15
million
people
.
Now
more
than
20
countries
around
the
world
have
Big
Brother
or
Expedition
Robinson
on
their
TV
screens
.
The
ordinary
people
who
take
part
in
the
programs
are
known
by
millions
of
people
in
their
own
countries
and
reality
TV
has
become
big
,
big
business
.
 
For
the
TV
producers
,
reality
TV
is
a
dream
come
true
because
many
of
the
programs
cost
nothing
to
make
.
At
some
point
,
the
television
viewers
are
asked
to
telephone
the
program
to
vote
or
to
apply
to
take
part
in
the
show
.
It
is
the
cost
of
these
telephone
calls
that
pays
for
the
shows
.
One
of
the
most
popular
shows
is
Pop
Idol
.
In
the
show
a
group
of
attractive
young
people
are
made
into
pop
stars
.
TV
viewers
vote
for
their
favorite
person
on
the
show
.
The
winner
makes
a
record
and
millions
of
copies
of
the
record
are
sold
.
His
or
her
pictures
are
published
on
the
covers
of
magazines
or
on
the
front
pages
of
newspapers
,
and
then
,
they
are
quickly
forgotten
.
 
But
not
everyone
is
happy
about
reality
TV
.
In
Portugal
,
two
TV
channels
got
into
trouble
because
they
showed
too
much
of
the
personal
lives
of
the
people
in
the
shows
.
In
France
,
reality
TV
is
called
""
rubbish
TV
""
and
the
TV
studios
of
Big
Brother
were
attacked
three
times
in
one
week
.
In
Greece
,
Big
Brother
was
described
as
""
against
human
rights
and
civilization
""

"Do
you
know
cows
can
climb
onto
the
roof
?
Is
n't
it
fun
?
To
eat
grass
,
a
Swiss
farmer
Dieter
Mueller
's
cow
climbed
up
a
roof
to
look
for
fresh
grass
.
 
Mueller
said
the
cow
was
walking
on
a
road
behind
the
house
.
Then
she
thought
the
grass
may
be
greener
on
the
other
side
of
it
,
but
it
did
n't
walk
around
,
it
decided
to
climb
over
the
house
.
In
fact
the
grass
was
not
greener
on
the
other
side
.
 
Mueller
said
this
is
a
cantankerous
cow
.
She
always
does
her
way
.
And
never
follow
his
words
.
So
it
is
quite
difficult
for
her
to
get
her
down
!
Mueller
tried
to
let
her
get
down
and
even
put
a
ladder
up
to
the
roof
,
but
it
does
n't
work
.
She
stayed
up
there
as
long
as
she
liked
.
She
just
had
to
do
things
in
her
own
sweet
time
.
 
At
last
she
was
tired
to
stay
on
the
farmhouse
roof
and
found
the
way
to
get
down
herself
.
 
That
's
really
good
news

,
it
often
carries
a
label
telling
who
made
it
or
from
what
store
it
was
bought
.
Indeed
,
some
labels
show
the
dress
is
famous
and
it
is
very
expensive
,
so
buyers
who
deal
with
the
cheapest
products
would
be
pleased
to
do
away
with
labels
entirely
.
 
However
,
there
is
another
label
more
important
than
the
one
showing
from
which
store
the
dress
was
bought
.
When
a
person
buys
a
fur
coat
,
or
a
jacket
,
from
a
store
,
a
label
telling
what
the
product
is
made
of
should
be
carried
to
it
.
 
This
label
is
required
by
law
.
Besides
telling
what
the
product
on
show
is
made
of
,
the
label
should
be
in
clear
English
and
be
where
one
can
find
it
easily
.
The
information
on
the
label
must
be
the
truth
.
 
The
reason
for
this
label
is
that
most
buyers
today
are
n't
expert
enough
to
know
exactly
what
kind
of
fur
or
material
they
are
buying
.
The
buyer
must
believe
in
the
store
that
sells
the
products
or
in
what
the
labels
say

"While
you
may
be
doing
everything
right
,
ignoring
just
one
or
two
steps
in
the
process
may
keep
you
from
getting
a
job
,
especially
in
this
fierce
market
.
Here
is
a
checklist
that
covers
some
of
the
major
links
in
the
job-search
chain
.
 
THE
RESUME
--
-
Make
sure
it
is
up-to-date
and
tailored
to
the
types
of
jobs
you
are
seeking
for
.
Have
someone
else
look
at
your
resume
.
If
you
can
not
afford
a
career
coach
,
give
your
resume
to
friends
or
family
members
to
scrutinize
Have
copies
of
your
resume
printed
so
that
you
are
ready
to
hand
them
out
at
interviews
.
 
COVERING
LETTERS
--
-
Maybe
you
've
set
up
a
few
basic
styles
in
advance
,
but
that
's
not
enough
.
Each
covering
letter
should
be
designed
to
suit
the
job
for
which
you
are
applying
.
 
THE
WARDROBE
--
-
Check
your
wardrobe
to
ensure
that
you
have
the
appropriate
professional
dress
,
including
shoes
,
ready
for
interview
.
 
NETWORKING
--
-
Do
n't
isolate
yourself
from
others
for
days
.
Network
through
e-mail
messages
,
phone
calls
,
appointments
and
meetings
keep
you
in
touch
with
the
outside
world
and
prevent
you
from
becoming
depressed
.
 
APPLICATION
--
-
A
glance
at
huge
online
job
sites
is
n't
usually
the
best
way
to
find
a
job
.
You
are
more
likely
to
succeed
through
the
people
you
know
via
networking
.
 
THE
FOLLOW
--
UP
--
-
It
is
quite
common
to
apply
for
job
and
never
hear
back
from
the
company
.
Take
measures
,
such
as
following
up
with
a
phone
call
a
week
or
so
after
you
apply
.
If
you
know
someone
at
the
company
,
check
whether
that
person
will
put
in
a
good
word
for
you
.
 
INTERVIEWS
--
-
If
you
've
got
plenty
of
interviews
but
no
return
calls
or
job
offers
,
take
a
look
at
your
interviewing
skills
.
This
is
one
area
where
investing
in
a
career
coach
may
pay
off
.
But
if
you
ca
n't
afford
one
,
try
to
find
a
job
group
or
service
that
conducts
free
mock
interviews
.
 
SUPPORT
SYSTEMS
--
-
Finally
,
recognize
that
looking
for
job
is
rather
difficult
.
Even
at
the
best
of
times
,
a
job
hunt
is
often
about
rejection
,
and
that
can
be
hard
to
endure
.
Staying
in
touch
with
family
,
friends
,
professional
networks
and
fellow
job
seekers
can
help
you
to
maintain
a
positive
attitude
and
a
sense
of
perspective

"To
err
is
human
.
To
blame
the
other
guy
is
even
more
human
.
 
Common
sense
is
not
all
that
common
.
 
Why
tell
the
truth
when
you
can
come
up
with
a
good
excuse
?
 
These
three
popular
misquotes
are
meant
to
be
jokes
,
and
yet
they
tell
us
a
lot
about
human
nature
.
To
err
,
or
to
make
mistakes
,
is
indeed
a
part
of
being
human
,
but
it
seems
that
most
people
do
n't
want
to
accept
the
responsibility
for
the
problem
.
Perhaps
it
is
the
natural
thing
to
do
.
The
original
quote
about
human
nature
went
like
this
:
""
To
err
is
human
,
to
forgive
,
divine
.
""
This
saying
mirrors
an
ideal
people
should
be
forgiving
of
others
'
mistakes
.
Instead
,
we
tend
to
do
the
opposite
-find
someone
else
to
pass
the
blame
on
to
.
However
,
taking
responsibility
for
something
that
went
wrong
is
a
making
of
great
maturity
.
 
Common
sense
is
what
we
call
clear
thought
.
Having
common
sense
means
having
a
good
general
plan
that
will
make
things
work
well
,
and
it
also
means
staying
with
the
plan
.
Common
sense
tells
you
that
you
take
an
umbrella
out
into
a
rainstorm
,
but
you
leave
the
umbrella
home
when
you
hear
a
weather
forecast
for
sunshine
.
Common
sense
does
not
seem
to
be
common
for
large
organizations
,
because
there
are
so
many
things
going
on
that
one
person
can
not
be
in
charge
of
everything
.
People
say
that
in
a
large
company
,
""
the
right
hand
does
not
know
what
the
left
hand
is
doing
.
""
 
And
what
is
wrong
with
a
society
that
thinks
that
making
up
a
good
excuse
is
like
creating
a
work
of
art
?
One
of
the
common
problems
with
making
excuses
is
that
people
,
especially
young
people
,
get
the
idea
that
it
's
okay
not
to
be
totally
honest
all
the
time
.
There
is
a
corollary
to
that
:
if
good
excuse
is
""
good
""
even
if
it
is
n't
honest
,
then
where
is
the
place
of
the
truth

"A
new
international
study
shows
that
six
people
die
every
minute
from
smoking
.
That
is
3
million
deaths
around
the
world
every
year
.
If
the
present
rate
of
smoking
continues
,
the
number
of
deaths
each
year
from
smoking
could
rise
to
10
million
by
the
year
2020
.
 
The
study
describes
smoking
is
the
biggest
cause
of
deadly
diseases
among
grown-ups
in
industrial
countries
.
So
far
most
of
the
smoking
deaths
have
happened
to
men
,
especially
in
developing
countries
.
 
A
researcher
at
the
World
Health
Organization
says
70
%
of
Chinese
men
smoke
more
than
15
cigarettes
each
day
.
In
Latin
America
about
50
%
of
the
men
are
smokers
.
There
also
are
a
very
large
number
of
smokers
in
Russia
and
in
Eastern
Europe
.
And
25
%
of
all
smoking
deaths
worldwide
are
in
those
areas
of
the
world
.
Scientists
say
smoking
will
kill
50
%
of
the
smokers
.
 
Smoking
is
known
to
cause
lung
cancer
.
It
also
can
lead
to
cancer
of
the
mouth
and
other
parts
of
bodies
.
Smokers
are
more
likely
than
non-smokers
to
suffer
from
heart
disease
.
 
Experts
say
that
people
reduce
their
chance
of
dying
from
smoking
if
they
stop
smoking
completely
.
They
say
smokers
who
give
up
smoking
can
improve
their
health

"London
Heathrow
is
the
biggest
airport
in
the
UK
,
and
it
also
handles
more
international
passenger
traffic
than
any
other
airport
in
the
world
.
For
this
reason
,
enlargement
was
planned
and
on
27th
March
a
fifth
terminal
opened
to
help
to
deal
with
the
many
passengers
that
pass
through
the
airport
.
The
new
terminal
has
taken
a
long
time
to
plan
and
build
.
The
idea
was
first
proposed
back
in
the
1980s
.
The
opening
of
it
has
been
talked
about
widely
in
the
media
in
the
UK
and
expectations
were
high
for
the
PS4.3
billion
project
.
 
However
,
in
spite
of
long
preparations
at
Terminal
5
ahead
of
the
grand
opening
,
things
soon
went
into
a
mess
.
There
were
problems
from
the
very
beginning
as
staff
had
difficulties
finding
car
parking
spaces
and
getting
through
security
to
get
into
the
building
.
This
consequently
caused
a
delay
when
passengers
started
to
arrive
and
large
numbers
of
staff
were
not
in
place
.
Long
passenger
queues
formed
and
the
slow
start
meant
that
everyone
had
to
play
catch-up
from
the
beginning
.
Staffs
were
having
problems
using
the
new
systems
and
a
baggage
operator
told
the
BBC
,
it
was
all
""
shambles
the
moment
the
doors
opened
""
.
The
terminal
has
been
designed
to
handle
12,000
bags
an
hour
but
due
to
a
reported
""
lack
of
training
and
essential
support
that
was
promised
""
,
a
backlog
of
luggage
soon
appeared
.
 
By
lunchtime
on
that
first
day
,
20
flights
had
been
cancelled
to
try
to
alleviate
the
problems
.
Flights
continued
to
be
cancelled
in
the
days
following
the
opening
and
up
to
28,000
bags
have
now
had
to
be
placed
in
temporary
storage
.
The
British
Airline
,
the
only
airline
operating
at
Terminal
5
says
it
is
working
to
clear
the
backlog
,
but
the
negative
publicity
caused
by
the
shambles
has
not
helped
the
airport
or
the
airline
's
reputation
at
all

"When
I
was
a
kid
,
I
used
to
spend
hours
listening
to
Adam
Carolla
and
Dr.
Drew
Pinsky
on
their
Sunday
night
radio
showLoveline
.
I
listened
so
often
that
I
began
to
use
one
of
their
well-known
phrases
--
""
good
times
""
--
in
my
daily
conversations
.
Scientists
have
a
name
for
this
phenomenon
:
behavioral
mimicry
.
 
You
've
probably
experienced
this
before
:
after
spending
enough
time
with
another
person
,
you
might
start
to
pick
up
on
his
or
her
behavior
or
speech
habits
.
You
might
even
start
to
develop
your
friend
's
habits
without
realizing
it
.
There
is
a
large
body
of
literature
concerning
this
sort
of
phenomenon
,
and
it
regularly
happens
for
everything
from
body
postures
to
accents
to
drink
patterns
.
For
example
,
one
study
found
that
young
adults
were
more
likely
to
drink
their
drink
directly
after
their
same-sex
drinking
partners
,
than
for
the
two
individuals
to
drink
at
their
own
paces
.
 
And
the
effect
is
n't
limited
to
real-life
face-to-face
activities
.
Another
study
found
that
the
same
you-drink-then-I-drink
pattern
held
even
when
watching
a
movie
!
In
other
words
,
people
were
more
likely
to
take
a
drink
of
their
drinks
in
a
theater
after
watching
the
actors
on
the
screen
enjoy
a
drink
.
At
least
I
do
n't
feel
so
strange
anymore
,
having
picked
up
on
Adam
Carolla
's
""
good
times
""
.
 
New
research
published
today
in
the
journalPLOS
ONEindicates
that
the
same
sort
of
behavioral
mimicry
is
responsible
for
social
eating
,
at
least
among
university-age
women
of
normal
weight
.
That
's
right
:
the
young
women
were
more
likely
to
adjust
their
eating
according
to
the
eating
pace
of
their
same-sex
dining
companion
.
 
As
with
most
experiments
,
these
results
raise
a
whole
new
set
of
questions
.
Still
,
the
finding
that
behavioral
mimicry
may
at
least
partly
account
for
eating
behavior
is
important
,
and
has
real
effects
on
health
.
The
researchers
note
that
""
as
long
as
people
do
n't
fully
recognize
such
important
influences
on
intake
,
it
will
be
difficult
to
make
healthy
food
choices
and
keep
a
healthy
diet
,
especially
when
people
are
exposed
to
the
eating
behavior
of
others

"Then
comes
July
,
and
with
it
examinations
,
but
these
are
soon
finished
and
with
them
ends
the
school
year
.
Boys
and
girls
have
nearly
two
months
'
holiday
before
them
as
they
leave
school
by
train
and
car
to
return
home
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
.
 
The
summer
holidays
are
the
best
part
of
the
year
for
most
children
.
The
weather
is
usually
good
,
so
that
one
can
spend
most
of
one
's
time
playing
in
the
garden
or
,
if
one
lives
in
the
country
,
out
in
the
woods
and
fields
.
Even
if
one
lives
in
a
big
town
,
one
can
usually
go
to
a
park
to
play
.
 
The
best
place
for
a
summer
holiday
,
however
,
is
the
seaside
.
Some
children
are
lucky
enough
to
live
near
the
sea
,
but
for
the
others
who
do
not
,
a
week
or
two
at
one
of
the
big
seaside
towns
is
something
that
they
will
talk
about
for
the
whole
of
the
following
year
.
 
In
England
,
it
is
not
only
the
rich
who
can
take
their
children
to
the
seaside
;
if
a
factory
worker
or
a
bus
driver
,
a
street
cleaner
or
a
waiter
wants
to
take
his
wife
and
children
to
Southend
or
Margate
,
Blackpoor
or
Clacton
,
he
is
usually
quite
able
to
do
so
.
 
Now
,
what
is
it
that
children
like
so
much
about
the
seaside
?
I
think
it
is
the
sand
,
sea
and
sun
more
than
any
other
things
.
Of
course
,
there
are
lots
of
new
things
to
see
,
nice
things
to
eat
,
and
exciting
things
to
do
,
but
it
is
the
feeling
of
sand
under
one
's
feet
,
of
salt
water
on
one
's
skin
,
and
of
the
warm
sun
on
one
's
back
that
make
the
seaside
what
it
is

"Nervous
suspects
locked
up
in
Britain
's
newest
police
station
may
feel
relieved
by
a
pleasant
yellow
color
on
the
door
.
If
they
are
close
to
confessing
a
crime
,
the
blue
on
the
wall
might
tip
the
balance
.
 
Gwent
Police
have
abandoned
colors
such
as
greys
and
browns
of
the
20th-century
police
cell
and
have
used
color
psychology
to
decorate
them
.
 
Ystrad
Mynach
station
,
which
recently
opened
at
a
cost
of
PS5
million
has
four
cells
with
glass
doors
for
prisoners
who
suffer
from
claustrophobia
.
Designers
have
painted
the
frames
yellow
,
which
researchers
say
is
a
calming
color
.
Other
cells
contain
a
royal
blue
line
because
psychologists
believe
that
the
color
is
likely
to
encourage
truthfulness
.
 
The
station
has
31
cells
,
including
12
with
a
""
live
scan
""
system
for
drunken
or
disturbed
prisoners
,
which
detects
the
rise
and
fall
of
their
chest
.
An
alarm
alerts
officers
if
a
prisoner
's
breathing
stops
and
carries
on
ringing
until
the
door
is
opened
.
 
Designers
and
psychologists
have
worked
for
years
on
color
.
Blue
is
said
to
suggest
trust
,
efficiency
,
duty
,
logic
,
coolness
,
thinking
and
calm
.
It
also
suggests
coldness
and
unfriendliness
.
It
is
thought
that
strong
blues
will
stimulate
clear
thought
and
lighter
,
soft
colors
will
calm
the
mind
and
aid
concentration
.
 
Yellow
is
linked
with
confidence
,
self-respect
and
friendliness
get
the
color
wrong
and
it
could
cause
fear
,
depression
and
anxiety
,
but
the
right
yellow
can
lift
spirits
and
self-respect
.
 
Ingrid
Collins
,
a
psychologist
who
specializes
in
the
effects
of
color
,
said
that
color
was
an
""
energy
force
""
.
She
said
:
""
Blue
does
enhance
communication
but
I
am
not
sure
it
would
enhance
truthful
communication
.
""
 
Yellow
,
she
said
,
affected
the
mind
.
Red
,
on
the
other
hand
,
should
never
be
considered
because
it
could
increase
aggression
.
Mrs.
Collins
praised
the
designers
for
using
colors
in
the
cells
.
Gwent
is
not
the
first
British
force
to
experiment
with
color
to
calm
down
or
persuade
prisoners
to
co-operate
,
In
the
1990s
Strathclyde
Police
used
pink
in
cells
based
on
research
carried
out
by
the
US
Navy

"I
've
done
many
things
that
would
make
any
parent
proud
.
I
've
taken
part
in
sports
,
community
work
and
school
events
,
but
I
am
most
proud
to
be
a
good
big
brother
.
I
have
to
watch
over
four
sisters
and
a
brother
,
plus
myself
.
That
's
quitea
task
,
but
one
I
feel
I
have
gotten
good
at
.
 
My
brother
needs
more
attention
than
most
siblings
.
When
he
was
nine
,
he
was
hit
by
a
pick-up
truck
on
the
way
to
the
bus
stop
and
lost
use
of
the
lower
two-thirds
of
his
body
.
He
's
been
in
a
wheelchair
for
six
years
.
My
brother
does
many
things
,
but
sometimes
he
tries
to
do
things
he
used
to
do
but
ca
n't
now
.
I
'
m
always
there
with
words
of
encouragement
.
 
I
now
watch
my
brother
struggle
to
do
as
many
things
as
he
can
within
and
beyond
his
limits
.
Should
he
fall
,
I
will
be
the
person
to
pick
him
up
.
I

"According
to
the
dictionary
definition
of
'create
'
,
ordinary
people
are
creative
every
day
.
To
create
means
to
bring
into
being
,
to
cause
to
exist
something
each
of
us
does
daily
.
We
are
creative
whenever
we
look
at
or
think
about
something
in
a
new
way
.
 
First
,
this
includes
an
awareness
of
our
surroundings
.
It
means
using
all
of
our
senses
to
become
aware
of
our
world
.
This
may
be
as
simple
as
being
aware
of
color1
and
texture
,
as
well
as
taste
,
when
we
plan
a
meal
.
Above
all
,
it
is
the
ability
to
notice
things
that
others
might
miss
.
 
A
second
part
of
creativity
is
an
ability
to
see
relationships
among
things
.
If
we
believe
the
expression
,
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
,
the
creativity
is
remaking
or
recombining
the
old
in
new
ways
.
For
example
,
we
might
do
this
by
finding
a
more
effective
way
to
study
or
a
better
way
to
arrange
our
furniture
,
or
we
might
make
a
new
combination
of
camera
lenses
and
filters
to
create
an
unusual
photograph
.
 
A
third
part
of
creativity
is
the
courage
and
drive
to
make
use
of
our
new
ideas
,
to
ask
for
them
to
achieve
some
new
results
.
To
think
up
a
new
idea
is
one
thing
;
to
put
the
idea
to
work
is
another
.
These
three
parts
of
creativity
are
included
in
all
the
great
works
of
geniuses
,
but
they
are
also
included
in
many
of
our
day
to
day
activities

"Although
there
is
no
formal
process
of
selection
,
in
larger
groups
,
leaders
are
usually
chosen
formally
through
election
or
recruitment
.
 
Although
leaders
are
often
thought
to
be
people
with
unusual
personal
ability
,
decades
of
research
have
failed
to
produce
evidence
that
there
are
any
""
natural
leaders
""
.
It
seems
that
there
is
no
set
of
personal
qualities
that
all
leaders
have
in
common
;
or
rather
,
any
person
may
be
recognized
as
a
leader
if
the
person
has
qualities
that
meet
the
needs
of
that
particular
group
.
 
Research
suggests
that
there
are
typically
two
different
leadership
roles
that
are
held
by
different
individuals
.
Instrumental
leadership
is
leadership
that
emphasizes
the
completion
of
tasks
by
a
social
group
.
Group
members
look
to
instrumental
leaders
to
""
get
things
done
""
.
Expressive
leadership
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
leadership
that
emphasizes
the
collective
well-beings
of
a
social
group
's
members
.
Expressive
leaders
are
less
concerned
with
the
overall
goals
of
the
group
than
with
providing
emotional
support
to
group
members
and
attempting
to
minimize
tension
and
conflict
among
them
.
 
Instrumental
leaders
are
likely
to
have
a
rather
secondary
relationship
to
other
group
members
.
They
give
others
and
may
discipline
group
members
who
inhibit
attainment
of
the
group
's
goals
.
Expressive
leaders
develop
a
more
personal
or
primary
relationship
to
others
in
the
group
.
They
offer
sympathy
when
someone
experiences
difficulties
and
try
to
solve
problems
that
threaten
to
divide
the
group
.
As
the
difference
between
these
two
roles
suggests
,
expressive
leaders
generally
receive
more
personal
affection
from
group
members
;
instrumental
leaders
,
if
they
are
successful
in
promoting
group
goals
,
may
enjoy
a
more
distant
respect

"The
skin
which
covers
the
tips
of
the
fingers
and
thumbs
is
crossed
by
numerous
ridges
arranged
in
different
patterns
.
These
patterns
are
permanent
from
birth
and
remain
exactly
the
same
throughout
a
person
's
life
,
even
when
the
skin
becomes
wrinkled
and
cracked
as
a
result
of
old
age
.
Such
patterns
are
never
passed
on
from
parents
to
children
,
and
no
one
in
the
world
has
the
same
patterns
as
anyone
else
.
Even
identical
twins
have
different
sets
of
fingerprints
.
As
a
result
,
fingerprints
offer
a
most
useful
and
foolproof
way
of
identifying
people
.
Any
ridged
part
of
the
hand
and
the
foot
may
be
used
as
a
means
of
identification
,
but
finger
impressions
are
usually
preferred
since
they
can
be
taken
easily
and
quickly
.
 
Fingerprints
are
classified
in
the
ways
:
by
general
shapes
and
contours
,
by
the
finger
positions
of
the
pattern-types
,
and
by
size
(
often
measured
by
counting
the
ridges
in
the
loops
)
.
Every
set
of
fingerprints
has
different
""
ridge
characteristics
""
(
i.
e.
the
print
of
each
separate
finger
is
different
from
that
of
all
the
other
fingers
)
,
which
belong
to
one
of
four
basic
groups
:
arches
,
loops
,
whorls
and
composites
.
All
fingerprints
can
then
be
divided
into
1
,
024
groups
.
By
using
details
in
the
patterns
above
,
these
1
,
024
groups
can
be
further
divided
into
thousands
of
smaller
groups
,
thus
making
it
possible
to
find
a
particular
set
of
fingerprints
in
a
few
minutes

"One
of
India
's
great
economic
advantages
is
the
youth
of
its
population
.
To
make
the
most
of
this
advantage
,
India
's
children
need
to
be
educated
.
On
paper
,
India
is
doing
well
here
.
The
country
has
a
nationwide
network
of
state
primary
schools
funded
by
a
specially
designed
tax
.
96
%
of
children
aged
6-14
go
to
school
,
even
in
rural
areas
.
That
's
well
above
the
average
for
the
developing
world
and
their
attendance
is
good
.
But
the
attainment
is
poor
:
three
quarters
of
third
graders
ca
n't
read
a
gradeone
text
and
53
%
of
grade
five
kids
ca
n't
read
at
the
standard
they
should
have
achieved
at
grade
two
.
Levels
of
achievement
are
almost
as
bad
in
math
.
 
""
The
main
problem
in
India
is
not
school
entry
or
whether
there
is
a
local
school
;
it
's
the
delivery
of
education
,
the
way
teaching
is
done
or
not
done
,
""
says
Vinati
Sukhdev
,
the
executive
director
of
Pratham
,
a
charity
that
campaigns
for
better
education
in
India
.
And
according
to
Ms.
Sukhdev
,
the
country
's
teachers
are
the
thirdbestpaid
in
the
world
but
they
're
poorly
trained
and
are
often
absent
.
Teacher
attendance
at
the
primary
level
is
only
85
%
,
according
to
Pratham
's
research
and
there
's
little
punishment
for
those
who
do
n't
turn
up
.
 
The
government
knows
that
state
schooling
needs
to
improve
.
In
2009
it
passed
the
Right
of
Children
to
Free
and
Compulsory
Education
Act
(
RTE
)
,
a
law
for
the
national
provision
of
free
,
childfriendly
education
.
It
says
that
there
should
be
two
teachers
for
every
60
students
and
that
they
should
go
to
work
regularly
,
get
there
on
time
,
follow
the
curriculum
,
assess
how
well
the
children
are
learning
and
meet
regularly
with
parents
.
 
""
What
we
need
to
do
next
is
improve
accountability
,
""
says
Ms.
Sukhdev
.
Schools
have
management
committees
that
are
supposed
to
include
parent
and
local
government
representatives
.
""
But
they
do
n't
work
or
people
do
n't
know
they
exist
.
""
Pratham
tries
to
help
local
communities
and
parents
drive
improvement
.
""
You
should
see
the
kind
of
reaction
we
get
when
they
realize
the
teacher
is
paid
but
is
n't
turning
up
!
""
says
Ms.
Sukhdev
.
""
We
ca
n't
be
everywhere
,
so
we
limit
ourselves
to
working
in
a
few
districts
,
where
we
can
create
model
schools
.
Then
we
try
to
work
together
with
local
government
to
make
sure
every
school
in
the
district
or
state
is
raised
to
that
level
.
""
 
The
Read
India
programme
is
an
example
of
what
targeted
help
can
achieve
.
Pratham
has
created
an
easytouse
teaching
and
assessment
pack
called
Learn
to
Read
.
It
has
trained
teachers
in
how
to
use
the
pack
at
school
and
showed
community
health
workers
,
volunteers
and
parents
how
it
could
support
learning
outside
school
.
The
programme
has
now
run
across
19
states
,
involving
450,000
volunteers
and
training
600,000
teachers
and
government
workers
.
Among
the
33
million
children
who
have
participated
,
the
number
of
those
who
can
read
simple
sentences
has
risen
by
20
%

"When
your
pet
has
an
emergency
,
first
aid
is
not
a
substitute
for
veterinary
treatment
.
However
,
before
you
are
able
to
get
your
pet
to
a
veterinarian
,
knowing
some
basic
first
aid
can
help
.
 
Bite
Wounds
 
Approach
the
pet
carefully
to
avoid
getting
bitten
.
Wear
a
mask
for
the
animal
and
then
check
the
wound
.
Clean
the
wound
with
large
amounts
of
saline
.
If
these
are
not
available
,
then
regular
water
may
be
used
.
Wrap
large
open
wounds
to
keep
them
clean
.
 
Bleeding
 
Apply
firm
,
direct
pressure
over
the
bleeding
area
until
the
bleeding
stops
.
Hold
the
pressure
for
at
least
10
minutes
.
Avoid
bandages
that
cut
off
circulation
.
 
Breathing
Stops
 
Check
to
see
if
the
animal
is
choking
on
a
foreign
object
.
If
an
animal
is
not
breathing
,
place
it
on
a
firm
surface
with
its
left
side
up
.
Check
for
a
heartbeat
.
If
you
hear
a
heartbeat
but
not
breathing
,
close
the
animal
's
mouth
and
breathe
directly
into
its
nose
--
not
the
mouth
--
until
the
chest
expands
.
Repeat
12
to
15
times
per
minute
.
 
Burns
 
Wash
the
burn
immediately
with
large
amounts
of
cool
,
running
water
.
Apply
an
ice
pack
for
15
--
20
minutes
.
Do
not
place
an
ice
pack
directly
on
the
skin
.
Wrap
the
pack
in
a
light
towel
or
other
cover
.
If
the
animal
has
large
quantities
of
dry
chemicals
on
it
skin
,
brush
them
off
.
Water
may
activate
some
dry
chemicals
.
 
Fractures
 
Symptoms
include
pain
,
inability
to
use
a
limb
.
Wear
a
mask
for
the
pet
and
look
for
bleeding
.
If
you
can
control
bleeding
without
causing
more
injury
,
then
do
so
.
Watch
for
signs
of
shock
.
Do
n't
try
to
set
the
fractures
by
pulling
the
limb
.
Transport
the
pet
to
the
veterinarian
immediately
,
supporting
the
injured
part
as
best
as
you
can

"When
I
recall
my
experiences
of
feeling
heard
and
deeply
understood
by
someone
,
I
know
how
much
the
experiences
helped
me
to
cope
With
whatever
I
was
dealing
with
at
the
time
.
Caring
people
who
I
have
turned
to
in
difficult
times
helped
me
the
most
by
listening
and
asking
about
my
feelings
.
 
During
one
of
my
volunteer
jobs
at
a
local
HIV
and
cancer
clinic
,
I
found
the
helpfulness
of
empathic
listening
.
As
a
volunteer
I
was
providing
emotional
support
for
people
with
health
related
problems
.
Empathic
listening
really
made
a
difference
on
how
patients
felt
about
their
health
problems
.
By
sharing
about
their
pain
and
suffering
and
my
willingness
to
listen
,
they
felt
less
alone
.
 
We
can
make
life
easier
for
each
other
by
becoming
a
better
listener
and
encouraging
each
other
to
share
our
feelings
.
We
can
become
a
better
listener
by
avoiding
giving
advice
and
trying
to
solve
problems
unless
we
are
asked
to
do
so
.
Pressuring
others
to
solve
their
life
problems
--
""
our
ways
""
--
is
not
helpful
.
Most
people
intuitively
know
how
to
solve
their
own
problems
.
As
a
listener
it
's
important
to
be
patient
and
not
to
interrupt
the
speaker
.
Let
them
know
it
's
OK
to
talk
about
their
feelings
and
support
them
in
feeling
their
feelings
.
 
When
one
neither
shares
nor
reaches
out
for
support
,
he
or
she
can
remain
a
lonely
mystery
.
Life
can
feel
lonely
when
one
keeps
everything
inside
.
Feeling
alone
with
life
problems
can
be
worse
than
the
problem
itself
.
When
we
let
a
caring
person
listen
to
our
life
struggle
,
we
will
no
longer
feel
alone
with
our
struggle
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
to
ask
your
loved
ones
to
take
time
to
hear
you
out
.
Sometimes
you
have
to
ask
for
it
.
People
can
not
read
your
mind
.
Confiding
in
others
can
have
a
positive
effect
on
our
mood

He

Later

Then
in

Li

Later
,
Li
did
n't
agree

change
their
musical
style

So
the
pair
went
their
separate

next
year

Unlike

does
very

He
spends
more

"Walking
certainly
is
n't
the
safe
activity
it
was
when
many
of
us
were
school
children
.
There
are
the
normal
safety
risks
such
as
speeding
vehicles
and
errant
bicycles
.
Here
are
a
few
tips
for
dads
of
children
who
are
early
morning
and
late
afternoon
pedestrians
.
 
Know
the
routes
your
children
take
.
Develop
a
safe
walking
route
to
school
and
insist
that
your
children
follow
it
.
Avoid
having
them
cross
busy
streets
except
where
there
is
a
signal
or
a
crossing
guard
.
If
your
child
does
not
make
it
to
school
or
home
and
if
you
have
a
standard
route
,
it
will
be
easier
to
track
them
down
.
 
Have
your
children
walk
with
others
.
This
may
seem
a
simple
rule
,
but
it
is
one
that
is
often
disregarded
.
A
boy
or
a
girl
alone
is
a
much
easier
target
for
a
predator
.
Make
sure
the
children
walk
in
a
group
.
And
besides
,
it
is
a
lot
more
fun
for
them
.
 
Follow
generally
smart
pedestrian
rules
.
Remind
them
to
use
sidewalks
where
possible
.
If
there
are
no
sidewalks
,
walk
on
the
side
of
the
road
as
far
to
the
right
as
possible
.
Where
possible
,
walk
on
the
side
of
the
road
facing
oncoming
traffic
so
they
can
see
anypotential
risks
before
they
get
to
them

"What
will
the
house
of
the
future
look
like
?
Architects
believe
that
there
are
all
possibilities
.
The
only
thing
for
sure
is
that
the
house
will
be
as
green
as
possible
.
 
The
tree
house
 
Many
architects
in
the
world
would
like
to
build
a
""
tree
house
.
""
Like
a
leaf
,
the
surface
of
the
house
collects
sunlight
during
the
day
.
The
energy
can
be
used
to
heat
water
,
produce
electricity
,
and
even
create
fresh
air
for
the
home
.
The
""
root
""
of
the
house
is
deep
under
the
ground
.
 
The
lizard
house
 
Like
a
lizard
,
changing
color
with
the
weather
is
the
most
important
design
of
a
lizard
house
.
When
it
's
in
the
bright
sun
,
the
cover
of
the
house
will
turn
dark
to
protect
it
from
strong
heat
.
During
dark
days
,
it
turns
white
and
takes
in
as
much
light
and
heat
as
possible
to
produce
energy
.
 
Meals
at
home
 
It
has
gardens
on
the
outside
wall
of
the
house
.
People
can
plant
tomatoes
,
carrots
and
green
tea
on
them
.
So
every
day
in
the
morning
,
you
just
need
to
walk
outside
and
collect
your
meals
.
 
Learning
from
the
past
 
Looking
to
the
future
is
n't
the
only
way
to
be
green
.
Sometimes
,
ancient
techniques
can
also
help
cut
down
energy
use
.
For
example
,
a
chimney
can
be
a
useful
air
conditioner
because
it
is
easier
for
hot
air
to
flow
out
at
the
chimney

"I
was
raised
on
a
farm
in
the
Fraser
Valley
along
with
five
sisters
and
one
brother
.
When
I
was
15
,
I
got
addicted
to
drinking
at
weekends
and
then
dropped
out
of
school
.
By
the
time
I
was
17
,
I
continued
to
drink
heavily
.
I
could
n't
find
a
job
to
support
myself
.
So
,
I
had
no
other
choice
but
to
join
the
army
.
I
retired
and
went
back
home
three
years
later
,
still
a
heavy
drinker
.
When
I
was
22
,
I
met
Sue
whose
father
was
also
a
heavy
drinker
,
so
my
behavior
did
n't
surprise
her
.
We
were
soon
married
and
later
had
two
daughters
.
 
I
started
my
first
business
when
I
was
in
my
mid-twenties
.
A
few
years
later
,
I
bought
a
large
chicken
farm
.
Even
with
this
success
,
though
,
my
drinking
was
always
a
problem
.
It
affected
my
marriage
and
family
so
much
that
I
knew
I
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
stop
drinking
.
So
I
tried
great
efforts
.
But
two
years
later
,
I
began
drinking
again
.
 
When
I
was
in
my
mid-thirties
,
I
sold
both
of
my
businesses
,
and
bought
the
big
house
on
the
hill
.
I
was
not
at
all
happy
,
although
I
had
everything
that
was
supposed
to
make
me
happy
.
I
sold
our
big
house
on
the
hill
and
bought
a
large
land
,
where
I
built
a
new
house
.
Our
marriage
was
in
big
trouble
,
and
my
finances
would
down
the
drain
.
.
For
the
first
time
in
many
years
,
I
had
to
go
to
work
for
someone
as
an
employee
.
I
took
a
job
as
a
heavy
equipment
operator
in
a
road
building
camp
.
 
My
marriage
still
came
apart
when
I
was
38
,
and
my
kids
had
to
go
through
our
divorce
.
I
spent
6
months
in
giving
up
drinking
on
a
school
camp
.
Nearly
a
year
later
,
I
met
my
childhood
neighbor
girl
,
June
.
We
were
married
not
long
afterwards
.
My
kids
learned
to
trust
me
again
and
I
have
two
stepchildren
that
also
love
me
.
 
Happy
life
continued
about
ten
years
.
Everything
was
going
so
well
when
I
felt
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
body
.
I
went
to
see
a
doctor
,
and
the
medical
examination
came
out
that
I
had
ALS
.
Record
shows
that
people
with
ALS
generally
survive
between
two
to
five
years
after
symptoms
appear
.
I
've
probably
had
the
symptoms
for
one-and-a-half
years
already
,
so
I
do
n't
know
how
much
time
I
have
left
...
.
God
knows

"All
over
the
world
,
libraries
have
begun
the
great
task
of
making
faithful
digital
copies
of
the
books
and
records
that
protect
the
mental
efforts
of
mankind*
.
For
armchair
schools
,
the
work
promises
to
bring
such
a
wealth
of
information
to
desktop
that
the
present
Internet
may
not
match
.
 
Librarians
see
three
clear
benefits
to
going
digital
.
First
,
it
helps
them
preserve
rare
and
easily
broken
objects
without
refusing
the
demands
of
those
who
wish
to
study
them
.
The
British
Library
,
for
example
,
holds
the
only
medieval
(
middle-aged
)
manuscript
of
Beowuif
in
London
.
Only
quantified
scholars
were
allowed
to
set
and
put
the
images
up
on
the
Internet
for
anyone
to
use
.
 
A
second
benefit
is
convenience
.
Once
books
arc
changed
to
digital
form
,
readers
can
find
them
in
seconds
rather
than
minutes
.
Several
people
can
read
the
same
book
or
view
the
same
picture
at
the
same
time
.
Clerks
are
spared
the
chore
of
reserving
.
And
libraries
could
use
the
Internet
to
lend
their
collections
to
those
who
are
unable
to
visit
in
person
.
 
The
third
advantage
of
electronic
copies
is
that
they
occupy
millimeters
of
space
on
a
magnetic
disk
rather
than
meters
on
a
shelf
.
The
cost
of
library
buildings
is
increasingly
high
.
The
University
of
California
at
prefix
=
st1
/Berkeleyrecently
spent
$
46
million
on
all
underground
addition
to
house
1
.
5
million
books
at
an
average
cost
of
$
30
per
set
of
them
.
The
price
of
disk
storage
on
the
contrary
,
has
fallen
to
about
$
2
per
300-page
publication
and
continues
to
drop"	"1

"We
human
beings
have
n't
been
good
friends
to
animals
.
For
thousands
of
years
,
we
have
been
polluting
the
environment
,
making
it
hard
for
animals
to
live
on
the
planet
.
We
have
been
killing
animals
for
their
fur
,
feathers
or
meat
,
or
simply
because
they
are
dangerous
.
As
a
result
,
many
kinds
of
animals
have
disappeared
forever
.
Hundreds
more
are
on
the
endangered
list
today
.
 
Should
we
care
about
animals
?
Of
course
we
should
.
If
animals
of
a
certain
kind
all
disappear
,
they
will
never
come
back
again
.
Animals
are
more
than
just
resources
of
things
we
need
.
Every
kind
of
animal
has
its
place
in
the
balance
of
nature
.
Destroying
any
kind
of
animal
can
lead
to
many
problems
.
For
example
,
when
farmers
killed
large
numbers
of
hawks
,
the
corn
and
grain
that
the
farmers
stored
were
destroyed
by
rats
and
mice
.
Why
?
Because
hawks
eat
rats
and
mice
.
With
less
and
less
hawks
to
keep
down
their
numbers
,
rats
and
mice
multiplied
quickly
.
And
if
people
kill
too
many
birds
,
more
and
more
insects
will
eat
the
crops
.
 
Luckily
,
we
've
realized
that
we
should
n't
kill
animals
any
more
.
And
people
are
working
hard
to
save
those
animals
that
would
disappear
soon
.
The
government
also
passed
laws
to
protect
the
endangered
animals
.
In
fact
,
quite
a
few
countries
have
passed
such
laws
.
These
laws
forbid
the
killing
of
any
kind
of
animal
on
the
endangered
list
.
We
should
try
our
best
to
protect
and
save
the
endangered
animals
."	"1

"Imagine
if
you
could
have
any
house
you
wanted
.
Money
is
no
object
.
You
can
place
the
house
anywhere
in
the
world
and
you
can
build
the
house
from
any
materials
you
wish
.
 
What
would
that
house
look
like
?
What
would
be
the
color1
and
texture
of
the
walls
,
the
shape
of
the
rooms
,
and
the
quality
of
the
light
?
 
Carl
Jung
said
:
""
When
I
was
a
child
,
I
dreamed
of
a
house
shaped
like
a
ring
.
Rooms
would
be
arranged
in
a
ring
around
a
central
courtyard
,
and
the
courtyard
would
have
a
glass
roof
,
a
steamy
climate
,
and
unusual
birds
.
All
windows
in
this
house
would
look
inward
at
the
courtyard
.
No
windows
would
look
outward
at
the
outside
world
.
This
was
an
introverted
,
perhaps
proud
,
house
.
 
As
I
aged
,
my
dream
house
reshaped
itself
.
Instead
of
an
inner
courtyard
,
it
developed
sociable
porches
and
big
bay
windows
.
The
house
of
my
dreams
reflected
who
I
was
becoming
.
""
 
For
the
psychologist
Carl
Jung
,
building
a
house
was
a
symbol
of
building
a
self
.
In
his
autobiographical
Memories
,
Dreams
,
Reflections
,
Jung
described
the
gradual
evolution
of
his
home
on
Lake
Zurich
.
Jung
spent
more
than
thirty
years
building
this
castle
-
like
structure
,
and
he
believed
that
the
towers
and
windows
represented
his
soul
.
 
Clare
Cooper
Marcus
said
,
""
Can
we
know
more
about
who
we
are
by
looking
at
where
we
live
?
""
Clare
Cooper
Marcus
,
a
Professor
of
Architecture
at
the
University
of
California
in
Berkeley
,
has
written
widely
about
the
relationship
between
homes
and
the
people
who
occupy
them
.
Her
book
House
as
a
Mirror
of
Self
explores
the
meaning
of
""
Home
""
as
a
place
of
self
-
expression
,
as
a
place
of
growing
,
and
as
a
place
of
sociability
.
Marcus
spent
years
looking
at
people
'
s
drawings
of
memorable
childhood
places
.
 
If
the
houses
we
live
in
are
so
significant
,
what
about
the
houses
we
imagine
?
What
do
our
wishes
say
about
who
we
are

"One
cold
,
rainy
night
in
1979
,
staying
on
the
deck
of
the
nuclear
attack
submarine
USS
Birmingham
entering
Hampton
Roads
Harbor
,
a
soldier
who
was
called
Jeff
Harris
was
suddenly
hit
by
a
huge
wave
that
took
away
his
ship
's
ball
cap
.
 
Months
later
,
while
walking
along
Chesapeake
Boulevard
beach
in
Hampton
,
Will
Miller
,
a
Vietnam
veteran
and
Navy
commander
,
happened
to
find
Harris
'
cap
which
was
half-buried
in
the
sand
then
.
Knowing
how
important
a
ship
's
cap
was
to
its
owner
,
Miller
saved
the
hat
,
hoping
one
day
to
find
its
owner
.
The
cap
was
packed
away
for
years
but
recently
appeared
again
at
Miller
's
home
in
Florida
.
 
""
It
suddenly
fell
out
of
a
box
onto
my
computer
keyboard
,
right
in
front
of
me
,
""
said
Miller
.
""
I
guessed
it
was
telling
me
,
'It
's
time
to
get
me
home
.
'
""
 
An
extensive
Internet
search
led
Miller
to
a
USS
Birmingham
website
and
finally
to
Harris
.
The
two
sent
e-mails
back
and
forth
,
and
one
night
Miller
's
phone
rang
.
 
""
This
is
Jeff
Harris
,
""
the
voice
on
the
phone
said
.
""
You
have
my
hat
!
""
 
The
two
sailors
talked
for
almost
half
an
hour
,
telling
sea
stories
to
each
other
and
thinking
of
the
common
relationship
between
seamen
.
""
 
""
Most
non-seagoing
people
would
n't
understand
how
much
a
sailor
likes
his
hat
,
""
Miller
said
.
""
Your
hat
protects
you
from
sun
,
wind
,
salt
and
cold
,
and
when
you
lose
it
,
especially
one
with
your
ship
's
name
on
it
,
it
's
a
big
thing
.
I
'm
delighted
to
get
it
back
to
Jeff
.

"Long
long
ago
,
there
was
a
man
who
was
good
at
shooting
arrows
.
He
asked
the
king
to
declare
him
as
the
greatest
archer
of
the
country
.
The
king
was
about
to
do
so
when
an
old
servant
of
the
king
said
,
""
Wait
,
sir
.
I
know
an
old
man
who
lives
in
the
forest
.
He
is
a
much
greater
archer
.
Let
this
young
man
go
to
him
and
learn
from
him
for
at
least
three
years
.
""
 
The
man
could
not
believe
what
the
servant
said
,
but
he
went
and
found
the
old
man
and
he
was
!
For
three
years
he
learned
from
him
.
Then
one
day
,
when
he
thought
he
had
learned
everything
,
the
thought
arose
in
him
:
""
If
I
kill
this
old
man
,
then
I
will
be
the
greatest
archer
.
""
 
The
old
man
had
gone
to
cut
wood
and
he
was
coming
back
carrying
wood
on
his
shoulder
.
The
young
man
hid
behind
a
tree
,
waiting
to
kill
him
.
He
shot
an
arrow
.
The
old
man
took
a
small
piece
of
wood
and
threw
it
.
It
struck
the
arrow
and
the
arrow
turned
back
and
wounded
the
young
man
very
deeply
.
The
old
man
came
,
took
out
the
arrow
and
said
.
""
I
knew
that
some
day
or
other
you
were
going
to
do
this
.
That
's
why
I
have
not
taught
you
this
secret
.
There
is
no
need
to
kill
me
.
My
Master
is
still
alive
,
and
I
'm
nothing
before
him
.
You
must
be
with
him
for
at
least
thirty
years
.
And
he
is
very
old
,
so
go
fast
!
Find
the
old
man
!

"It
was
an
afternoon
Truman
would
never
forget
.
 
Rayburn
and
his
friend
were
talking
in
the
office
before
Truman
arrived
.
The
telephone
rang
.
It
was
a
call
from
the
White
House
asking
whether
Vice-President
Truman
had
arrived
yet
.
No
,
Rayburn
replied
.
The
caller
asked
to
have
him
telephone
the
White
House
as
soon
as
he
arrived
.
 
Truman
entered
a
minute
later
.
He
immediately
called
the
White
House
.
As
he
talked
,
his
face
became
white
.
He
put
down
the
phone
and
raced
out
of
the
door
to
his
car
.
 
Truman
arrived
at
the
White
House
within
minutes
.
An
assistant
took
him
to
the
president
's
private
living
area
.
Eleanor
Roosevelt
,
the
president
's
wife
,
was
waiting
for
him
there
.
""
Harry
,
""
she
said
,
""
the
president
is
dead
.
""
Truman
was
shocked
.
He
asked
Mrs.
Roosevelt
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
to
help
her
.
But
her
reply
made
clear
to
him
that
his
own
life
had
suddenly
changed
.
""
Is
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
?
""
Mrs.
Roosevelt
asked
the
new
president
,
""
You
are
the
one
in
trouble
now
.
""
 
Truman
had
been
a
surprise
choice
for
vice-president
at
the
Democratic
Party
nominating
convention
in
nineteen
forty-four
.
Delegates
considered
several
other
candidates
before
they
chose
him
as
Roosevelt
's
running
mate
.
That
was
at
a
time
when
presidential
candidates
did
not
make
their
own
choices
for
vice-president
.
 
Harry
Truman
lacked
the
fame
,
the
rich
family
and
the
strong
speech-making
skills
of
Franklin
Roosevelt
.
He
was
a
much
simpler
man
.
He
grew
up
in
the
Midwestern
state
of
Missouri
.
Truman
only
studied
through
high
school
but
took
some
nighttime
law
school
classes
.
He
worked
for
many
years
as
a
farmer
and
a
small
businessman
,
but
without
much
success
.
 
Truman
had
long
been
interested
in
politics
.
When
he
was
almost
forty
,
he
finally
won
several
low-level
positions
in
his
home
state
.
By
nineteen
thirty-four
,
he
was
popular
enough
in
Missouri
to
be
nominated
and
elected
to
the
United
States
Senate
.
And
he
won
re-election
six
years
later
.
 
Most
Americans
,
however
,
knew
little
about
Harry
Truman
when
he
became
president
.
They
knew
he
had
close
ties
to
the
Democratic
Party
political
machine
in
his
home
state
.
But
they
had
also
heard
that
he
was
a
very
honest
man
.
They
could
see
that
Truman
had
strongly
supported
President
Roosevelt
's
New
Deal
programs
.
But
they
could
not
be
sure
what
kind
of
president
Truman
would
become
.
 
At
the
center
of
all
the
action
was
Harry
Truman
.
It
was
not
long
before
he
showed
Americans
and
the
world
that
he
had
the
ability
to
be
a
good
president
.
He
was
honest
,
strong
and
willing
to
make
decisions

"A
student
walks
into
his
first
class
and
realizes
he
forgot
all
about
the
midterm
exam
.
He
knows
he
needs
to
bring
his
grades
up
,
and
getting
a
zero
will
make
it
nearly
impossible
.
He
quickly
jots
down
some
notes
and
shoves
them
under
his
lap
hoping
it
will
help
him
pass
.
Cheating
is
a
major
concern
in
all
academic
environments
.
Students
are
creating
new
and
more
outrageous
ways
of
cheating
every
day
;
some
claim
that
certain
accounts
of
cheating
can
be
justified
,
but
overall
it
can
always
be
prevented
.
 
Cheating
has
been
around
forever
,
and
millions
of
ways
to
cheat
have
been
fashioned
.
Copying
homework
and
cheat
sheets
are
some
of
the
most
basic
ways
students
in
all
education
levels
have
cheated
.
Some
students
think
nothing
about
writing
a
few
answers
on
their
hand
,
in
a
gum
wrapper
,
or
boldly
using
a
study
guide
to
cheat
.
Desperate
students
have
even
gone
as
far
as
to
steal
the
test
or
scan
in
bottle
wrappers
and
put
answers
into
the
nutrition
label
.
The
internet
has
now
become
available
in
almost
every
location
.
Computers
can
be
accessed
at
school
,
at
home
,
and
now
even
on
cell
phones
.
This
opens
a
doorway
for
even
more
methods
of
cheating
to
be
born
.
 
There
are
countless
opinions
on
whether
or
not
cheating
can
be
justified
.
The
truth
is
this
behavior
will
always
be
a
matter
of
opinion
with
each
scenario
of
cheating
.
Students
often
rationalize
their
cheating
by
claiming
they
forgot
to
look
over
the
material
or
did
not
understand
what
the
teacher
or
professor
was
saying
.
Some
may
counter
these
arguments
by
saying
that
the
student
could
have
set
reminders
or
asked
the
teacher
to
explain
the
material
before
the
day
of
the
test
.
Some
other
reasons
students
believe
cheating
is
justified
are
their
heavy
workloads
and
trying
to
find
time
for
school
,
sports
,
friends
,
and
family
.
This
may
be
true
in
certain
instances
,
however
,
all
students
have
these
problems
,
and
it
is
unfair
to
the
students
refrain
from
cheating
when
the
student
who
is
dishonest
receives
a
better
grade
.
The
majority
of
students
who
think
cheating
is
acceptable
may
believe
the
reason
for
this
is
that
sometimes
students
are
unaware
they
are
cheating
,
there
is
not
enough
time
given
for
assignments
,
or
that
the
information
is
too
much
for
the
course
.
 
It
may
be
difficult
to
accomplish
,
but
cheating
can
be
prevented
.
Teachers
and
professors
have
tried
many
options
to
stop
cheating
.
These
options
can
range
anywhere
from
simply
spreading
test-takers
out
in
a
room
,
to
expelling
a
student
,
which
will
most
likely
hindertheir
plans
of
getting
into
another
college
.
One
simple
way
to
fix
the
problem
is
to
scold
the
student
when
caught
.
They
may
be
so
scared
or
embarrassed
that
they
never
do
it
again
.
This
is
a
risky
way
to
prevent
cheating
in
some
cases
,
however
,
because
it
can
possibly
damage
self-esteem
.
Another
simple
way
to
avoid
cheating
is
to
create
many
different
kinds
of
the
same
test
.
This
prohibits
students
from
getting
the
answers
off
of
a
neighbor
's
test
,
but
students
still
have
the
option
of
using
other
cheating
tactics
.
 
There
may
be
a
million
ways
to
cheat
and
get
away
with
it
,
but
there
are
few
times
,
if
any
,
that
it
is
justified
.
Cheating
never
has
to
be
a
necessity
and
is
never
worth
compromising
morals
and
losing
years
worth
of
working
towards
a
degree
.
This
problem
is
spreading
throughout
America
;
with
everyone
's
help
,
it
can
be
stopped

"As
the
pace
of
life
continues
to
increase
,
we
are
fast
losing
the
art
of
relaxation
.
Once
you
are
in
the
habit
of
rushing
through
life
,
being
on
the
go
from
morning
till
night
,
it
is
hard
to
slow
down
.
But
relaxation
is
necessary
for
a
healthy
mind
and
body
.
 
Stress
is
a
natural
part
of
everyday
life
and
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
it
.
In
fact
,
it
is
not
the
bad
thing
it
is
often
supposed
to
be
.
A
certain
amount
of
stress
is
vital
to
provide
motivation
and
give
purpose
to
life
.
It
is
only
when
the
stress
gets
out
of
control
that
it
can
lead
to
poor
performance
and
ill
health
.
 
The
amount
of
stress
a
person
can
bear
depends
very
much
on
the
individual
.
Some
people
are
not
afraid
of
stressand
such
characters
are
obviously
important
material
for
managerial
responsibilities
.
Others
lose
heart
at
the
first
signs
of
unusual
difficulties
.
When
exposed
to
stressin
whatever
formwe
react
both
chemically
and
physically
.
In
fact
we
make
choices
between
""
fight
""
and
""
flight
""
and
in
more
ancient
days
the
choice
made
the
difference
between
life
and
death
.
The
crises
we
meet
today
are
unlikely
to
be
so
extreme
,
but
however
little
the
stress
,
it
involves
the
same
response
.
It
is
when
such
a
reaction
lasts
long
,
through
continued
exposure
to
stressthat
health
becomes
endangered
.
Such
serious
conditions
as
high
blood
pressure
and
heart
disease
have
established
links
with
stress
.
Since
we
can
not
remove
stress
from
our
lives
(
it
would
be
unwise
to
do
so
even
if
we
could
)
,
we
need
to
find
ways
to
deal
with
it

"Every
girl
dreams
she
could
be
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
.
Some
girls
went
under
the
knife
to
change
their
looks
.
 
Rim
Seong
Wan
,
a
23-year-old
girl
,
did
some
operations
in
2009
,
and
she
looked
different
.
Before
the
operations
,
she
was
shy
because
she
thought
she
was
not
beautiful
.
After
the
operations
,
she
had
much
bigger
eyes
and
higher
nose
.
When
she
talks
with
others
,
there
is
always
a
big
smile
on
her
face
.
 
Rim
has
more
clients
than
others
.
When
she
does
the
work
,
she
's
much
happier
and
can
finish
it
more
quickly
.
She
's
called
the
most
talented
girl
in
the
company
.
 
Rim
's
changes
made
her
life
better
.
However
,
the
scientists
did
n't
think
it
was
good
to
change
life
by

"Just
how
popular
was
Mini
?
Very
.
Every
year
her
classmates
voted
her
the
favorite
student
.
The
friends
she
had
were
much
more
than
those
of
anyone
else
.
 
One
day
Mini
was
caught
yakkety-yakking
and
ordered
to
stay
back
as
punishment
.
Staying
back
meant
doing
something
""
useful
""
,
like
helping
in
the
library
after
school
.
 
Now
Mini
's
school
had
a
rule
.
Once
a
month
,
if
you
had
something
else
to
do
the
day
you
were
punished
,
you
could
ask
a
friend
to
stand
in
for
you
.
 
Unluckily
,
her
aunt
was
visiting
Mini
that
day
.
That
afternoon
was
the
only
chance
Mini
had
of
seeing
her
for
another
five
years
.
 
Mini
needed
someone
to
stand
in
for
her
.
She
asked
Betty
,
her
""
best
""
friend
.
""
Oh
,
no
,
Mini
,
I
ca
n't
,
""
Betty
said
.
""
I
must
help
my
brother
do
his
homework
.
""
 
""
Tony
,
will
you
stay
back
for
me
?
""
Mini
asked
another
friend
.
""
I
wish
you
'd
told
me
earlier
.
I
have
to
go
to
a
relative
's
house
with
my
father
,
""
he
said
.
 
Now
,
Mini
was
beginning
to
doubt
if
even
one
of
her
friends
would
agree
to
stay
.
But
she
tried
again
.
She
asked
three
more
friends
and
each
one
refused
.
 
So
,
after
school
Mini
stayed
to
help
the
librarian
.
And
,
when
she
found
Mini
crying
after
everyone
had
left
,
it
was
she
who
surprised
Mini
by
allowing
her
to
leave
to
meet
her
aunt
.
""
I
may
have
many
friends
,
""
Mini
said
to
herself
,
""
but
in
reality
I
have
none
.

"Sun
Liping
,
6
,
lives
in
a
small
village
in
Yunnan
.
Her
biggest
wish
is
to
have
running
water
in
her
home
.
All
35
families
in
Sun
's
village
have
a
serious
problem
--
-
they
do
n't
have
enough
water
.
Every
day
,
the
villagers
have
to
walk
20
minutes
to
get
water
.
 
Last
year
,
the
worst
drought
since
the
1950s
hit
Yunnan
,
making
more
than
2
million
people
short
of
drinking
water
.
This
year
,
the
drought
is
even
worse
.
 
Not
only
Yunnan
,
but
many
other
provinces
in
China
are
short
of
water
as
well
,
such
as
Gansu
and
Qinghai
.
 
According
to
a
report
on
February
17
,
each
Chinese
person
has
about
28
%
of
the
world
's
average
person
's
amount
of
available
water
.
Two
thirds
of
China
's
cities
are
short
of
water
and
nearly
300
million
people
in
rural
areas
do
n't
have
safe
water
for
drinking
.
 
Every
drop
of
water
is
important
.
Waste
a
drop
of
water
a
day
and
you
lose
a
bucket
a
year
.
How
can
we
use
water
in
a
smart
way
?
Here
are
some
tips
for
you
to
save
water
in
your
daily
life
:
 
1
.
Put
plastic
bottles
of
water
in
your
toilet
to
cut
down
the
water
waste
when
you
flush
your
toilet
.
 
2
.
Do
n't
keep
the
water
running
while
you
're
brushing
your
teeth
or
washing
your
face
and
hands
.
 
3
.
Use
low-flow
shower
heads
.
 
4
.
Use
a
bucket
to
collect
shower
water
while
you
wait
for
it
to
warm
up
.
 
5
.
Make
your
shower
time
shorter
.
 
6
.
Set
up
a
rain
bucket
to
collect
rainwater
for
watering
plants
or
flowers

"Today
our
lives
are
changing
faster
than
at
any
time
in
history
.
Here
we
report
on
three
important
changes
that
will
have
a
big
impact
on
our
everyday
lives
in
the
future
.
 
The
cashless
society
 
Cash
and
bank-notes
will
disappear
almost
completely
.
They
will
be
replaced
by
smart
cards
,
namely
plastic
cards
:
microchip
processors
loaded
with
some
money
.
When
we
pay
for
goods
,
the
shop
assistant
will
put
our
smart
card
into
a
payment
terminal
and
money
will
come
into
his
card
from
our
card
.
When
all
the
money
is
used
up
,
we
will
be
able
to
reloadit
by
putting
it
into
a
telephone
,
dialing
our
bank
account
and
money
will
be
put
into
the
card
from
the
account
.
 
Interactive
telephones
 
Talking
computers
will
play
an
important
part
.
They
will
recognize
speech
,
ask
us
what
information
we
need
,
look
through
a
database
,
and
put
the
information
into
speech
.
If
we
want
to
book
a
flight
or
pay
a
bill
by
phone
,
we
will
interact
with
a
talking
computer
to
do
so
.
Human
telephone
operators
will
be
used
only
for
more
complex
operations
such
as
dealing
with
complaints
or
solving
special
problems
.
 
Traffic
jams
in
cities
will
be
reduced
because
drivers
will
use
electronic
route
maps
to
find
the
quickest
route
to
their
destination
.
Electronic
systems
will
start
changing
motorists
for
driving
in
cities
.
As
soon
as
motorists
have
to
pay
to
drive
in
cities
,
they
will
stop
using
their
cars
and
use
public
transport
instead
.
Speed
control
systems
will
be
built
into
cars
.
These
systems
will
automatically
regulate
the
speed
of
the
car
to
take
account
of
traffic
and
weather
conditions
and
prevent
accidents
.
It
will
be
many
years
before
these
changes
bring
results
but
when
they
do
,
there
will
be
a
great
improvement
in
road
safety
.
 
With
the
development
of
science
and
technology
,
more
and
more
advanced
things
will
be
invented
or
created
.
Life
in
the
future
is
undoubtedly
different
from
that
at
the
present

"Memory
,
they
say
,
is
a
matter
of
practice
and
exercise
.
If
you
have
the
wish
and
really
make
a
conscious
effort
,
then
you
can
quite
easily
improve
your
ability
to
remember
things
.
But
even
if
you
are
successful
,
there
are
times
when
your
memory
seems
to
play
tricks
on
you
.
 
Sometimes
you
remember
things
that
really
did
not
happen
.
One
morning
last
week
,
for
example
,
I
got
up
and
found
that
I
had
left
the
front
door
unlocked
all
night
,
yet
I
clearly
remembered
locking
it
carefully
the
night
before
.
 
Memory
""
tricks
""
work
the
other
way
as
well
.
Once
in
a
while
you
remember
not
doing
something
and
then
find
out
that
you
did
.
One
day
last
month
,
for
example
,
I
was
sitting
in
a
barbershop
waiting
for
my
turn
to
get
a
haircut
,
and
suddenly
I
realized
that
I
had
got
a
haircut
two
days
before
at
the
barbershop
across
the
street
from
my
office
.
 
We
always
seem
to
find
something
funny
and
interesting
in
incidents
caused
by
people
's
forgetfulness
or
absent-mindedness
.
Stories
about
absent-minded
professors
have
been
told
for
years
.
Unfortunately
,
however
,
absent-mindedness
is
not
always
funny
.
There
are
times
when
""
tricks

of
our
memory
can
cause
us
great

"Have
you
ever
heard
the
saying
""
If
you
want
a
friend
,
be
one
""
?
 
Here
is
how
a
new
teacher
made
friends
with
the
girls
and
boys
in
her
class
on
the
first
day
of
school
.
As
the
bell
rang
,
the
teacher
smiled
at
each
girl
and
boy
.
Then
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
,
""
Good
morning
.
How
nice
it
is
to
have
all
of
you
in
my
class
this
year
.
I
'd
like
to
know
each
of
you
.
I
am
sure
we
will
enjoy
working
together
.
""
Everyone
felt
that
she
meant
what
she
said
because
of
her
sweet
voice
and
her
friendly
look
.
 
She
told
the
girls
and
boys
her
name
and
wrote
it
on
the
blackboard
.
Then
she
told
them
some
of
the
things
she
liked
to
do
and
she
was
hoping
to
do
with
them
during
the
year
.
 
Then
she
said
to
the
class
,
""
Now
you
know
my
name
and
the
things
I
like
and
I
want
to
know
your
names
and
the
things
you
like
.
Then
I
will
feel
that
I
know
you
.
""
 
Could
you
make
friends
by
doing
the
same
as
this
teacher
did
?
 
One
way
of
getting
to
know
girls
and
boys
in
your
class
is
to
find
out
more
about
them
.
It
is
often
easy
to
be
friends
with
those
people
who
have
the
same
hobbies
with
you
.
You
play
the
same
games
and
go
on
journeys
together
.
 
You
may
find
that
some
new
comers
in
your
class
miss
their
old
friends
and
feel
strange
and
lonely
.
You
can
invite
them
to
take
a
walk
or
to
ride
bikes
with
you
.
You
will
find
many
things
in
common
to
talk
about
.
Just
talking
together
in
a
friendly
manner
is
one
good
way
to
make
friends

"Nations
plan
next
steps
to
end
global
warming
 
On
December
3
,
more
than
10,000
scientists
,
environmental
activists
and
government
officials
from
187
countries
met
in
Bali
,
Indonesia
,
which
is
the
largest
global
warming
conference
ever
held
.
 
One
of
the
main
goals
of
the
two-week
meeting
is
to
develop
a
replacement
for
the
international
treaty
called
the
Kyoto
Protocol
,
which
has
been
signed
by
174
,
countries
,
calling
for
limits
on
the
emission
of
greenhouse
gases
.
 
Under
the
Kyoto
Protocol
,
nations
were
legally
bound
to
reduce
greenhouse
gases
,
but
since
it
was
signed
in
2005
,
they
have
continued
to
increase
worldwide
.
Of
the
largest
greenhouse
gas
emitters
,
only
Russia
and
Japan
have
agreed
to
follow
me
rules
.
China
and
India-second
and
sixth
on
the
list-are
making
efforts
to
make
cuts
.
 
The
U.S
signed
the
treaty
in
1997
but
has
not
yet
agreed
to
follow
the
strict
rules
,
which
require
that
greenhouse
gas
release
be
reduced
by
10
%
by
2012
.
U.S.
officials
are
opposed
to
these
mandatory
,
or
required
,
cuts
in
emissions
.
""
We
're
worrying
that
it
would
be
too
costly
and
would
hurt
the
U.S.
economy
.
But
we
're
not
here
to
be
a
roadblock
,
""
said
Harlan
L.
Watson
,
a
top
U.S.
climate
official
.
 
Even
if
greenhouse
gases
are
reduced
,
scientists
say
it
will
take
decades
or
longer
to
stop
the
global
warming
that
is
already
underway
.
To
help
poor
countries
deal
with
rising
temperatures
and
climate
changes
,
the
UN
has
developed
the
""
Adaptation
Fund
""
to
help
them
improve
farming
techniques
and
water
systems
.
 
But
so
far
,
it
has
only
raised
$
67
million
.
 
""
The
money
should
come
from
the
countries
most
responsible
and
most
capable
,
""
said
Kate
Raworth
,
a
senior
research
official
from
the
Oxfam
International
aid
group
.
She
listed
the
U.S.
,
European
Union
,
Japan
,
Australia
and
Canada

"Some
mothers
in
Senegal
are
learning
a
new
way
to
save
the
lives
of
babies
born
too
soon
.
The
idea
is
borrowed
from
the
way
mother
kangaroos
carry
their
young
in
front
in
a
pouch
.
The
baby
kangaroo
stays
in
this
built-in
baby
carrier
until
it
can
survive
independently
.
 
Kangaroo
mother
care
is
also
known
as
the
skin-to-skin
method
for
premature
babies
.
The
direct
contact
with
the
mother
keeps
the
baby
warm
.
It
also
lets
the
baby
breastfeed
at
any
time
.
The
mother
's
heartbeat
also
helps
control
the
baby
's
breathing
rate
.
 
Every
year
,
seven
thousand
babies
are
born
at
the
health
center
where
Ousmane
Ndiaye
works
in
Guediaway
,
outside
Dakar
.
One
in
five
is
underweight
.
But
Senegal
has
few
incubators
in
which
to
keep
premature
babies
warm
.
In
Africa
,
one
newborn
in
twenty
dies
.
A
major
reason
is
prematurity
,
so
the
death
rates
are
among
the
highest
in
the
world
.
 
Doctor
Ndiaye
says
babies
who
weigh
less
than
two
kilos
get
special
attention
from
midwives
who
assist
with
the
births
.
They
teach
the
mother
how
to
keep
the
baby
wrapped
to
her
chest
.
The
health
center
has
a
Kangaroo
Clinic
,
a
special
area
for
teaching
this
method
.
 
Doctor
Ndiaye
says
they
plan
to
expand
the
program
throughout
Senegal
.
But
he
believes
the
best
way
to
get
more
people
to
use
the
kangaroo
method
is
for
mothers
who
have
used
the
method
to
tell
others
about
it

"Starting
from
this
month
,
you
wo
n't
be
hearing
the
word
""
NBA
""
on
sports
programs
on
CCTV
.
Instead
,
sport
hosts
will
give
the
full
Chinese
name
when
they
refer
to
the
NBA
-
National
Basketball
Association
.
You
also
wo
n't
hear

's
Chinese
programs
,
such
as
GDP
(
gross
domestic
product
)
or
WTO
(
World
Trade
Organization
)
.
You
will
hear
their
Chinese
translations

CCTV
received
a
notice
from
the
State
Administration
of
Radio
,
Film
and
Television
,
telling
it
to
avoid
using
English-language
abbreviations
in
their
reports
to
protect
the
""
purity
""
of
the
Chinese
language
.
A
few

also
received
the
notice

Fu
Zhenguo
,
an
editor
of
People

,
is
one
of
the
people
who
proposed
the
change
.
""
Using
English
in

Chinese-speaking
environment
is
against
Chinese
law

""
he
said
.
""
Using
English
on
Chinese

programs
is
unfair
to
people
who
do
n't

It
will
have
a
bad
language
influence
on
kids

But
some
experts
have
a
different
opinion
.
Liu
Yaoying
,
a
professor
at
the
Communications
University
of
China
,
said
the
move
shows
cultural
conservatism
.
""
If
Western
countries
can
accept
some
Chinglish
words
,
why
ca
n't
the
Chinese
language
be
mixed
with
English
?

Liu
said
.
 
A
lot
of
people
have
criticized
the
move
,
saying
that
it
will
cause
problems
for
them
.
 
""
I

"My
name
is
Tony
,
13
years
old
from
Los
Angeles
.
I
often
eat
my
lunch
at
school
.
My
mother
is
a
nurse
.
She
thinks
most
of
the
foods
the
students
eat
at
school
are
healthy
.
The
cooks
make
different
food
and
I
can
eat
different
things
every
day
.
I
choose
my
favorite
things
.
Today
,
I
have
some
noodles
,
an
apple
,
a
cookie
and
a
glass
of
milk
.
Milk
is
n't
my
favorite
drink
.
Juice
is
my
favorite
,
but
they
have
n't
got
any
juice
today
.
I
always
have
a
cookie
.
It
is
n't
healthy
food
,
but
it
is
my
favorite
part
of
my
school
meal
.
Apples
are
n't
my
favorite
fruit
,
but
they
have
n't
got
any
oranges
.
Sometimes
I
give
my
apple
to
my
friend
Sam
.
Sam
gives
me
some
chocolate
for
the
apple
.
 
My
mother
makes
sure
I
can
eat
a
healthy
dinner
.
She
never
gives
me
hamburgers
,
cola
,
candy
,
ice
cream
and
too
much
meat
.
She
thinks
eating
a
lot
of
fruit
,
vegetables
,
some
noodles
,
rice
,
fish
,
cheese
and
milk
is
good
for

"Why
are
so
many
students
not
doing
well
?
Why
is
there
such
a
huge
achievement
gap
between
urban
and
suburban
students
?
Just
this
week
,
in
my
school
the
seventh
grade
team
leader
called
a
meeting
to
discuss
academic
detention
.
The
purpose
of
the
detention
is
to
allow
students
who
are
doing
poorly
a
second
chance
to
redo
the
work
.
Now
if
a
student
did
not
understand
an
assignment
I
have
no
trouble
allowing
that
student
to
redo
a
test
or
give
some
extra
credit
work
,
but
if
a
student
did
poorly
because
he/she
opted
not
to
do
the
work
out
of
sheer
laziness
,
that
student
should
not
be
given
a
second
chance
.
 
And
parents
should
be
held
accountable
for
their
children
.
That
is
another
reason
why
there
is
such
a
huge
achievement
gap
.
All
children
should
be
monitored
at
home
in
order
to
achieve
great
success
in
school
.
Perhaps
it
might
be
a
great
idea
for
urban
school
districts
to
offer
free
classes
to
parents
on
how
to
help
their
students
at
home
.
Of
course
this
idea
is
far
fetched
,
after
all
we
do
not
want
to
offend
the
parents
.
What
we
will
do
instead
is
to
spend
a
fortune
on
teacher
training
because
if
the
kids
are
not
doing
well
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
teacher
.
That
kind
of
mindset
,
if
allowed
to
continue
will
be
a
perfect
recipe
for
greater
achievement
gaps
.
 
I
started
working
at
my
current
school
in
August
and
I
have
been
in
the
teaching
field
for
25
years
.
What
I
believe
is
that
you
can
lead
a
horse
to
water
but
you
ca
n't
make
that
horse
drink
.
You
ca
n't
force
kids
to
change
bad
habits
over
night
,
nor
can
we
afford
to
lower
standards
just
so
a
kid
can
pass
a
class

"A
farmer
had
four
lambs
.
One
was
black

and
the
other
three
were
white
.
The
black
lamb
was
friendly
to
the
others
in
the
group
.
But
the
white
lamb
s
often
laughed
at
him
.
They
thought
he
was
ugly
.
The
farmer
did
not
like
him
,
either
.
He
gave
bad
food
to
the
black
lamb
.
 
One
winter
day
,
the
four
lambs
went
out
to
eat
grass
.
They
went
far
away
from
home
.
Suddenly
,
it
began
to
snow
.
It
was
such
a
heavy
snow
that
the
ground
was
all
white
soon
.
They
could
n't

way
home

When
the
farmer
found
that
the
lambs
were
not

,
he
went
out
to
look

them
.
There
was
snow
everywhere

Suddenly
,
he
saw
something
black
.
He
went
to
it

Oh
,
it
was
his
black
lamb
!
And
the
white
lambs
were
there

"My
description
of
a
hero
is
a
person
who
sacrifices
his
all
for
others
.
A
person
who
puts
others
before
himself
.
A
person
who
does
ordinary
things
,
not
because
they
have
to
,
but
because
they
want
to
.
 
So
I
got
to
think
who
are
my
heroes
?
Several
people
came
to
mind
.
But
there
was
one
that
really
stuck
out
in
my
mind
.
I
guess
I
really
thought
about
it
,
but
this
man
really
is
my
hero
.
This
man
is
my
dad
.
 
I
know
,
we
all
think
our
dads
are
our
heroes
.
But
the
truth
is
,
I
really
ca
n't
ever
remenber
thinking
of
my
dad
really
as
a
hero
.
I
am
sure
that
I
have
said
that
he
was
.
But
I
an
not
sure
if
I
ever
really
thought
about
in
terms
of
what
is
a
hero
?
I
mean
he
never
saved
anyone
's
life
.
He
never
fought
in
a
war
.
He
never
invented
anything
to
make
life
easier
for
others
.
But
as
I
thought
of
his
qualities
.
I
found
myself
saying
yes
,
he
is
a
hero
.
 
My
dad
is
like
other
dads
.
He
worked
hard
to
provide
for
his
family
.
He
made
sure
that
the
bills
were
paid
.
He
made
sure
that
there
was
money
to
buy
food
,
and
clothes
for
his
family
.
But
that
is
what
Daddys
are
supposed
to
do
.
So
that
does
n't
really
make
him
a
hero
.
It
just
means
that
he
is
a
man
who
wants
the
best
for
his
family
,
even
if
that
means
he
has
to
go
without
.
 
In
my
eyes
what
makes
my
dad
a
hero
is
his
faith
.
My
dad
is
a
man
who
has
a
very
deep
belief
in
his
faith
.
He
has
put
a
good
life
before
us
his
children

Passage
1
 
Every
morning
,
when
we
wake
up
,
we
have
24
brand-new
hours
to
live
.
What
a
 
gift
!
We
have
the
capacity
to
live
in
a
way
that
these
24
hours
will
bring
peace
,
joy
,
and
happiness
to
ourselves
and
to
others
.
 
Peace
is
right
here
and
now
,
in
ourselves
and
in
everything
we
do
and
see
.
The
question
is
whether
or
not
we
are
in
touch
with
it
.
We
do
n't
have
to
travel
far
away
to
enjoy
the
blue
sky
.
We
do
n't
have
to
leave
our
city
or
even
our
neighborhood
to
enjoy
the
eyes
of
a
beautiful
child
.
Even
the
air
we
breathe
can
be
a
source
of
joy
.
 
We
can
smile
,
breathe
,
walk
,
and
eat
our
meals
in
a
way
that
allows
us
to
be
in
touch
with
the
abundance
of
happiness
that
is
available
.
We
are
very
good
at
preparing
how
to
live
,
but
not
very
good
at
living
.
We
know
how
to
sacrifice
ten
years
for
a
diploma
,
and
we
are
willing
to
work
very
hard
to
get
 
But
we
have
difficulty
remembering
that
we
are
alive
in
the
present
moment
,
the
only
moment
there
is
for
us
to
be
alive
.
Every
breath
we
take
,
every
step
we
make
,
can
be
filled
with
joy
,
peace
,
and
serenity
.
We
need
only
to
be
awake
,
alive
in
the
present
moment
.
 
Passage
2
 
The
 
of
both
 
is
that
we
were
but
to
open
ourselves
to
the
richness
of
the
moment
,
to
concentrate
on
 
,
we
would
be
filled
with
bliss
.
I
have
lived
in
the
present
from
time
to
time
and
can
tell
you
that
it
is
much
overrated
.
Occasionally
,
as
a
holiday
from
stroking
one
's
memories
or
brooding
about
future
worries
,
I
grant
you
,
it
can
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
.
But
to
""
be
here
now
,
""
hour
after
hour
,
would
never
work
.
I
do
n't
even
approve
of
stories
written
in
the
present
tense
.
Ads
for
poets
who
never
use
a
past
participate
,
they
deserve
the
eternity
they
are
striving
for
.
 
Besides
,
the
 
has
a
way
of
intruding
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
Why
should
I
go
out
of
my
way
to
meet
it
?
Let
it
splash
on
me
from
time
to
time
,
like
a
car
going
through
a
puddle
,
and
I
,
on
the
sidewalk
of
my
solitude
,
will
salute
it
grimly
like
any
other
modern
inconvenience
.
 
If
I
attend
a
concert
,
obviously
not
to
listen
to
the
music
but
to
find
 
in
which
to
meditate
on
the
past
and
future
.
I
realize
that
there
may
be
moments
when
the
music
invades
my
ears
and
I
am
forced
to
pay
attention
to
it
,
note
for
note
.
I
believe
I
take
such
intrusions
gracefully
.
The
present
is
not
always
 
,
so
long
as
it
does
n't
stay
too
long
and
cut
into
my
remembering
or
brooding
time

"The
sound
of
a
mosquito
can
mean
trouble
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.
The
bite
of
the
mosquito
can
be
deadly
.
The
insects
carry
serious
diseases
like
malaria
.
It
is
estimated
that
almost
630,000
people
died
from
malaria
and
malariarelated
causes
in
2012
,
and
most
of
these
cases
were
in
African
countries
.
 
In
the
United
States
,
a
group
of
California
scientists
are
working
to
develop
a
more
effective
and
less
costly
substance
to
protect
people
from
mosquitoes
.
The
researchers
are
investigating
the
sense
of
smell
in
mosquitoes
.
They
found
the
insects
use
the
same
receptor
for
identifying
carbon
dioxide
in
human
breath
as
they
do
for
the
smell
of
our
skin
.
Anandasankar
Ray
,
who
is
leading
the
investigation
,
says
scientists
tested
more
than
a
million
chemical
compounds
until
they
found
a
substance
called
Ethyl
Pyruvate
.
He
says
Ethyl
Pyruvate
makes
the
mosquitoes
'
receptors
inactive
.
""
When
we
apply
Ethyl
Pyruvate
to
a
human
arm
and
offer
it
to
hungry
mosquitoes
in
a
cage
,
very
few
of
the
mosquitoes
are
attracted
to
the
human
arm
because
only
a
few
of
them
are
able
to
smell
it
out
,
""
said
Ray
.
 
Genevieve
Tauxe
,
a
member
of
the
research
team
,
says
it
was
not
easy
to
find
the
neurons
of
noble
cells
that
recognize
both
the
smell
of
human
breath
and
skin
.
""
With
the
device
used
to
examine
the
mosquito
,
we
are
able
to
insert
a
very
small
electrode
into
the
part
of
the
mosquito
's
nose
,
where
its
smelling
neurons
are
and
where
the
smell
is
happening
,
""
said
Tauxe
.
 
Anandasankar
Ray
says
a
product
based
on
Ethyl
Pyruvate
may
cost
less
to
produce
than
DEFT
,
the
most
effective
chemical
treatment
now
in
use
.
He
says
DEFT
is
too
costly
for
most
people
who
live
in
areas
affected
by
malaria
.
 
""
Perhaps
by
finding
smells
that
can
attack
other
target
receptors
,
we
will
be
able
to
improve
upon
DEFT
and
finally
have
the
next
generation
of
insect
behaviour
control
products
,

"Joe
Temper
should
have
known
better
.
After
all
,
he
works
for
a
large
auto
insurance
company
.
It
wo
n't
hurt
to
leave
the
key
in
the
truck
this
once
,
he
thought
,
as
he
filled
his
gas
tank
at
a
self-service
gas
station
.
But
minutes
later
,
as
he
was
paying
the
money
,
he
saw
the
truck
being
driven
away
.
 
In
2010
,
1.6
million
motor
vehicles
were
stolen
in
the
United
States
--
one
every
20
seconds
.
If
present
trends
continue
,
experts
predict
vehicle
thefts
could
be
over
two
million
every
year
by
the
end
of
the
decade
.
 
Vehicle
theft
is
a
common
phenomenon
,
which
has
a
direct
effect
on
over
four
million
people
a
year
.
The
cost
is
astonishing
.
 
Many
police
officials
blame
professional
thieves
for
the
large
number
of
the
thefts
.
It
is
a
major
moneymaker
for
organized
crime
.
Typically
,
stolen
cars
are
taken
to
pieces
and
the
parts
sold
to
individuals
.
But
as
many
as
200,000
cars
are
smuggled
out
of
the
country
every
year
.
Most
go
to
Latin
America
,
the
Middle
East
and
Europe
.
 
Only
about
15
percent
car
thefts
result
in
an
arrest
,
because
few
police
departments
specially
conduct
in
depth
auto
investigations
.
When
thieves
are
arrested
,
judges
will
often
sentence
them
to
probation
,
not
immediately
put
them
in
prison
because
the
prisons
are
overcrowded
with
violent
criminals
.
 
One
exception
is
a
Michigan
program
that
calls
for
92
police
officers
to
work
full
time
on
the
state
's
65,000
car
theft
cases
a
year
.
Since
2006
,
when
the
effort
began
,
the
state
's
auto
theft
rate
has
fallen
from
second
in
the
nation
to
ninth
.
 
How
can
you
protect
your
car
?
If
you
live
in
a
high
theft
area
or
drive
an
expensive
model
,
consider
a
safety
system
.
It
may
cost
anywhere
from
$
25
to
$
1,000
.
Some
systems
work
automatically
-
simply
removing
the
key
disables
the
fuel
pump
and
the
starter
.
When
cars
are
equipped
with
such
systems
,
thefts
may
drop
by
one
third
.
In
some
states
,
you
may
be
able
to
use
a
device
that
transmits
radio
signals
,
allowing
stolen
cars
to
be
tracked
by
police

"I
was
in
a
shopping
mall
recently
,
and
I
decided
to
go
and
get
a
cup
of
tea
.
As
I
was
making
my
way
to
the
coffee
shop
,
I
noticed
an
old
gentleman
rather
poorly
dressed
sitting
on
a
bench
nearby
.
I
knew
from
the
first
sight
that
he
was
in
need
of
some
kind
of
help
.
He
had
a
little
lunch
in
front
of
him
and
was
wholeheartedly
enjoying
it
.
 
There
was
a
young
man
in
front
of
me
in
the
line
also
waiting
to
be
served
.
The
young
man
handed
the
servant
a
twenty-dollar
bill
and
asked
for
an
orange
juice
as
well
as
a
favor
.
The
servant
looked
at
the
young
man
with
a
little
surprise
,
not
fully
understanding
him
.
The
young
man
asked
her
to
give
the
juice
to
the
old
gentleman
eating
his
lunch
outside
on
the
bench
.
The
young
man
also
told
her
that
he
would
be
watching
every
second
so
that
she
would
be
completely
safe
at
all
times
.
Later
,
there
was
a
wonderful
exchange
between
the
waitress
and
the
old
man
.
I
only
wished
I
had
taken
a
photo
of
the
smiles
on
both
of
their
faces
.
 
As
I
was
thinking
about
this
event
later
on
,
I
wondered
why
the
young
man
did
n't
just
perform
this
act
of
kindness
himself
.
I
thought
he
was
hoping
that
this
act
of
kindness
might
inspire
others
to
do
something
for
the
old
man
as
well
.
Thinking
of
the
happy
smiles
on
the
old
man
's
face
,
I
felt
how
worthwhile
it
is
to
help
others

"If
you
want
to
live
longer
and
lower
the
risk
of
heart
disease
,
a
move
to
the
mountains
may
help
.
Research
by
scientists
in
Greece
shows
that
living
in
the
mountains
is
good
for
the
heart
and
longevity
.
People
living
at
higher
altitude
have
lower
possibility
of
dying
from
heart
disease
than
those
closer
to
sea
level
,
even
if
they
have
factors
that
could
increase
their
risk
.
""
Residence
in
mountainous
areas
seems
to
have
a
'protective
effect
'
from
heart
disease
,
""
said
Dr
Nikos
Baibas
of
the
University
of
Athens
.
He
and
his
colleagues
suspect
that
the
increased
exercise
from
walking
up
mountainous
area
gives
the
heart
a
good
workout
and
enables
it
to
cope
with
lower
levels
of
oxygen
.
 
Researchers
studied
the
health
records
and
death
rates
of
1,150
Greeks
who
lived
in
three
villages
near
Athens
over
15
years
.
One
village
was
1,000
meters
above
sea
level
and
the
other
two
were
in
low-lying
areas
.
Although
men
and
women
living
in
the
mountainous
village
had
higher
blood
pressure
rates
and
other
risk
factors
than
people
in
the
other
villages
,
they
had
a
lower
rate
of
death
from
heart
disease
and
other
causes
after
a
fifteen
year
follow-up
.
""
The
contrast
was
more
evident
among
men
than
among
women
,
""
Baibas
added
in
a
report
in
theJournal
of
Epidemiology
and
Community
Health
.
Heart
disease
is
one
of
the
world
's
top
killers
.
Smoking
,
high
blood
pressure
,
raised
cholesterol
levels
,
being
overweight
and
a
family
history
of
the
illness
increase
the
possibility
of
developing
the
disease

"BEIJING
,
Feb.
10
(
Xinhua
)
--
China
's
economic
planning
agency
Thursday
announced
a
rise
in
minimum
rice
purchase
prices
this
year
to
encourage
farmers
to
grow
more
grain
.
 
A
statement
on
the
National
Development
and
Reform
Commission
(
NDRC
)
website
said
the
government
would
continue
the
policy
of
minimum
purchase
prices
in
major
rice-growing
regions
in
2011
.
The
rises
in
the
minimum
rice
purchase
price
had
been
approved
by
the
State
Council
,
China
's
Cabinet
,
said
the
statement
.
 
The
purchase
prices
for
japonica
rice
will
rise
21.9
percent
to
128
yuan
(
19.4
U.S.
dollars
)
per
50
kilograms
,
while
prices
for
early
and
middle-late
rice
will
increase
9.7
percent
and
10.3
percent
to
102
yuan
and
107
yuan
per
50
kg
respectively
.
 
Rice
and
wheat
are
two
major
grain
crops
in
China
.
 
The
State
Council
pledged
Wednesday
to
step
up
efforts
to
boost
grain
production
as
drought
continues
to
wreak
havoc
in
north
China
's
wheat
growing
regions
.
 
China
's
main
wheat-growing
regions
,

"One
morning
,
Sam
went
to
school
by
bus
.
It
was
a
long
way
,
so
he
wore
a
Bluetooth
earphone
to
listen
to
music
.
 
Suddenly
,
an
old
woman
went
up
to
him
and
said
quietly
,
""
Good
morning
,
sir
!
""
He
was
surprised
but
asked
in
a
friendly
way
,
""
What
's
up
,
Madam
?
""
 
The
old
woman
did
n't
answer
him
.
But
she
looked
happy
and
turned
to
an
old
man
next
to
her
and
said
loudly
,
""
You
see
.
His
audiphones
must
be
pretty
great
.
I
said
in
a
quiet
voice
,
but
he
could
still
hear
me
.
""
 
Sam
got
even
more
surprised
.
He
did
n't
know
what
happened
.
Just
then
,
the
old
man
moved
quickly
to
him
and
asked
:
""
Excuse
me
,
young
man
.
In
which
store
can
I
buy
the
audiphones
you
're
using
?

"It
goes
without
saying
that
human
intelligence
is
very
advanced
as
opposed
to
plants
and
other
living
creatures
.
People
's
capacity
to
fully
understand
,
reason
,
organize
,
solve
problems
,
display
emotional
intelligence
,
learn
,
communicate
and
think
abstractly
is
outstanding
.
It
is
believed
to
be
much
more
emphasized
nowadays
,
when
bright
folks
are
normally
one
level
higher
than
everyone
else
.
 
Nowadays
many
people
are
of
the
view
that
a
high
intelligence
quotient
(
IQ
)
is
an
excellent
assistance
in
pulling
through
life
.
Statistics
reveal
that
whatever
activity
enabling
the
brain
to
function
and
operate
,
no
matter
whether
in
the
form
of
difficulties
or
other
obstacles
that
can
be
overcome
by
this
specific
body
area
,
has
a
positive
effect
on
it
.
 
So
every
time
you
are
making
full
use
of
your
mind
for
right
answers
in
a
quick
crossword
or
if
you
are
answering
difficult
riddles
,
you
might
be
,
in
fact
,
raising
the
probabilities
of
increasing
your
intelligence
.
You
could
play
effective
brain
games
like
crosswords
,
chess
,
riddles
,
puzzles
,
Internet
games
,
word
games
and
other
games
.
These
are
useful
in
raising
your
intelligence
primarily
because
they
let
you
think
in
a
different
way
as
you
make
an
effort
to
uncover
answers
to
certain
problems
.
Aside
from
this
,
this
form
of
brain
training
continually
encourages
the
brain
to
function
and
widen
its
capacity
to
concentrate
and
learn
.
 
Needless
to
say
,
you
've
to
make
sure
that
you
make
the
most
of
these
brain
exercises
by
not
cheating
yourself
.
Lastly
,
if
you
progress
to
a
much
more
complicated
level
,
try
your
best
to
answer
difficult
problems
with
no
hints
or
clues
so
that
you
are
able
to
further
force
your
brain
to
work
on
its
own

"It
is
never
too
late
to
try
to
make
your
dreams
come
true
.
This
could
be
Mary
Moe
's
motto
--
the
expression
that
best
presents
her
spirit
.
Mary
Moe
has
done
a
lot
during
the
past
91
years
.
For
much
of
that
time
,
she
wanted
to
fly
,
but
never
had
the
chance
--
until
now
.
She
recently
achieved
her
life-long
dream
.
 
Mary
just
learned
how
to
fly
an
airplane
,
a
dream
she
has
had
since
she
was
a
little
girl
.
Growing
up
,
she
was
inspired
by
two
American
pilots
:
Charles
Lindburgh
Amelia
Earhart
.
They
became
her
inspiration
.
Lindbugh
made
the
solo
nonstop
flight
across
the
Atlantic
Ocean
in
1927
.
Five
years
later
,
Earhart
became
the
first
woman
to
make
the
flight
.
But
Mary
Moe
could
not
find
time
to
make
her
dream
come
true
.
At
age
34
,
she
was
just
too
busy
--
busy
fighting
cancer
.
She
was
also
busy
with
her
job
in
advertising
and
busy
raising
her
family
.
 
There
was
simply
no
time
to
think
about
flying
a
plane
.
And
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
drive
to
the
airport
.
Lessons
were
costly
.
Everything
seemed
to
be
working
against
Mary
.
 
""
I
had
actually
gone
out
to
that
airport
in
the
1980s
to
see
about
flying
lessons
and
it
was
such
a
long
drive
out
and
expensive
and
I
thought
,
'No
,
I
have
to
put
this
on
the
back
burner
for
a
while
.
'
""
So
her
dream
had
to
wait
.
She
kept
it
on
the
back
burner
.
Then
,
at
age
91
,
her
wish
finally
came
true
.
 
Ms
Moe
learned
about
Wish
of
a
lifetime
.
Wish
of
a
Lifetime
is
a
non-profit
organization
whose
goal
is
to
change
the
way
our
society
thinks
about
aging
and
older
adults
.
 
Sally
Webster
works
for
the
group
.
Wish
of
Lifetime
helps
older
people
,
senior
citizens
,
enjoy
a
dream
.
It
also
sends
the
message
that
it
is
never
too
late
for
a
dream
.
So
they
really
try
to
look
for
those
stories
that
are
inspiring
and
can
show
people
that
older
Americans
can
achieve
things
just
like
younger
Americans
can

"I
carry
a
Rubik
's
Cube
in
my
backpack
.
Solving
it
quickly
is
a
terrific
conversation
starter
.
I
usually
ask
people
to
try
it
first
.
They
just
turn
the
cube
over
in
their
hands
,
not
even
knowing
where
to
begin
.
That
's
exactly
what
it
was
like
for
me
to
learn
how
to
read
.
Letters
and
words
were
out
of
order
.
Nothing
made
sense
because
I
am
dyslexic
.
 
The
Rubik
's
Cube
has
made
me
believe
that
sometimes
you
have
to
take
a
few
steps
back
in
order
to
move
forward
.
This
was
a
reflection
of
my
own
life
when
I
had
to
leave
public
school
after
the
fourth
grade
.
It
's
embarrassing
to
admit
,
but
I
still
could
n't
always
spell
my
full
name
correctly
.
As
a
fifth-grader
at
a
new
school
specializing
in
what
's
called
""
language-processing
disorder
""
,
I
had
to
start
over
.
I
then
spent
the
next
four
years
learning
how
to
learn
and
find
strategies
that
allowed
me
to
return
to
my
district
's
high
school
with
the
ability
to
communicate
my
ideas
and
express
my
intelligence
.
 
Now
,
I
can
easily
solve
the
5x5x5
.
I
discover
that
just
before
it
is
solved
,
a
problem
can
look
like
a
mess
,
and
then
suddenly
you
can
find
the
solution
.
Early
in
my
Rubik
's
career
,
I
became
so
frustrated
that
I
took
the
cube
apart
and
rebuilt
it
.
I
believe
that
sometimes
you
have
to
look
deeper
and
find
answers
in
unexpected
places
.
The
Rubik
's
cube
taught
me
that
to
accomplish
something
big
,
it
helps
to
break
it
down
into
small
pieces
.
I
learned
that
it
's
important
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
thinking
,
to
try
to
find
connections
and
patterns
.
I
believe
that
there
are
surprises
around
the
corner
.
 
Like
life
itself
,
the
Rubik
's
cube
can
be
frustrating
puzzle
.
So
everyday
I
carry
a
Rubik
's
cube
in
my
backpack
as
a
reminder
that
I
can
achieve
my
goals
,
no
matter
what
obstacles
I
face

"Humankind
has
tried
to
improve
its
standard
of
living
since
the
very
beginning
of
civilization
.
Back
then
,
as
well
as
today
,
providing
food
and
security
was
the
basic
task
for
a
person
.
However
,
nowadays
the
range
of
required
goods
has
expanded
significantly
.
People
feel
the
need
for
not
only
some
primary
things
,
such
as
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
roof
over
their
heads
,
but
also
for
various
facilities
and
luxuries
.
Providing
humanity
with
these
things
is
connected
to
the
use
of
natural
resources
,
which
requires
energy
.
In
turn
,
the
common
sources
of
energy
we
use
today
cause
pollution
,
so
economic
growth
is
almost
unavoidably
associated
with
environmental
damage
.
 
Economic
growth
is
the
increase
in
numbers
of
goods
and
services
produced
over
time
by
an
economy
,
and
it
is
calculated
in
terms
of
real
Gross
Domestic
Product
(
GDP
)
.
Before
growth
is
calculated
,
inflation
is
adjusted
in
order
to
take
into
account
its
misleading
effect
on
the
price
of
goods
and
services
.
Economic
growth
can
also
be
explained
as
the
increase
in
expected
output
,
which
results
from
an
increase
in
actual
output
,
or
total
demand
.
 
There
are
certain
aspects
of
economic
growth
which
affect
the
environment
.
The
first
of
these
is
the
fact
that
in
order
to
produce
more
goods
and
products
,
at
a
faster
rate
,
the
construction
of
large
industrial
plants
is
required
.
These
plants
produce
a
lot
of
waste
,
leading
to
the
pollution
of
water
and
the
atmosphere
,
which
may
cause
negative
long
term
health
effects
to
nearby
populations
of
animals
,
or
people
.
They
also
lead
to
global
warming
.
 
Industrial
manufacturing
leads
to
the
constantly
increasing
energy
consumption
.
The
traditional
energy
sources
,
which
are
commonly
used
nowadays
,
are
considered
to
be
the
greatest
polluters
to
the
environment
.
There
also
exist
so-called
eco-friendly
sources
of
energy
.
They
are
sometimes
preferred
but
replacing
the
traditional
sources
with
them
also
requires
time
,
during
which
people
have
to
make
some
sacrifices
to
support
these
undertakings
.
 
In
order
to
produce
economically
practical
energy
,
a
sometimes
significant
transformation
of
the
natural
site
is
often
inevitable
.
This
is
expensive
and
,
has
harmful
effects
on
the
environment
.
Application
of
wind
energy
would
block
airflows
'
natural
speed
which
is
the
reason
for
their
decrease
in
strength
,
after
crossing
the
windmill
.
Consequently
,
the
pressure
balance
that
is
brought
about
by
this
current
will
be
affected
,
and
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
environment
and
weather
conditions
are

"Have
you
ever
heard
someone
use
the
phrase
""
once
in
a
blue
moon
""
?
People
use
this
expression
to
describe
something
that
they
do
not
do
very
often
.
For
example
,
someone
might
say
that
he
tries
to
avoid
eating
sweets
because
they
are
unhealthy
,
but
will
eat
chocolate
""
once
in
a
blue
moon
""
.
Or
someone
who
does
not
usually
like
to
go
to
the
beach
might
say
""
I
visit
the
shore
once
in
a
moon
.
""
While
many
people
use
this
phrase
,
not
everyone
knows
the
meaning
behind
it
.
 
The
first
thing
to
know
is
that
the
moon
itself
is
never
really
blue
.
This
is
just
an
expression
.
In
fact
,
the
phrase
""
blue
moon
""
has
to
do
with
the
shape
of
the
moon
,
not
the
color
.
 
As
the
moon
travels
around
the
earth
,
it
appears
to
change
shape
.
We
associate
names
with
certain
shapes
of
the
moon
.
For
example
,
when
we
can
see
a
small
part
of
the
moon
,
it
is
called
a
crescent
moon
.
A
crescent
is
a
shape
that
looks
like
the
tip
of
a
fingernail
.
When
we
can
not
see
the
moon
at
all
,
it
is
called
a
new
moon
.
When
we
can
see
the
whole
moon
,
it
is
called
a
full
moon
.
Usually
,
there
is
only
one
full
moon
every
month
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
there
will
be
two
full
moons
in
one
month
.
When
this
happens
,
the
second
full
moon
is
called
a
""
blue
moon
""
.
 
Over
the
next
20
years
,
there
will
only
be
15
blue
moons
.
As
you
can
see
,
a
blue
moon
is
a
very
rare
event
.
This
fact
has
led
people
to
use
the
expression
""
once
in
a
blue
moon
""
to
other
very
rare
events
in
their
lives

"BEIJING
--
Seven
prestigious
universities
in
China
announced
Sunday
that
they
would
begin
using
the
same
independent
exam
--
besides
the
national
one
--
to
test
students
hoping
to
gain
entrance
to
them
in
2011
.
 
The
seven
are
Peking
University
,
Beihang
University
,
Beijing
Normal
University
,
Nankai
University
,
Fudan
University
,
Xiamen
University
and
Hong
Kong
University
.
 
Students
who
want
to
gain
entrance
to
any
of
the
seven
universities
will
only
have
to
sit
one
independent
exam
,
according
to
the
joint
announcement
.
 
""
This
will
help
lighten
the
students
'
load
,
otherwise
they
must
take
several
exams
for
different
universities
,
""
said
the
announcement
.
 
Passing
the
exam
could
result
in
more
than
one
interview
chance
,
giving
the
students
more
opportunities
to
choose
their
favorite
universities
.
 
China
'
s
college
entrance
exam
system
is
undergoing
reform
as
universities
aim
to
select
students
based
on
independent
criteria
rather
than
just
using
the
results
of
the
national
exam
.
 
In
2003
,
Peking
University
and
another
21
universities
were
allowed
to
pilot
the
reform
by
using
their
own
criteria
to
independently
select
five
percent
of
their
students
.
 
Now
nearly
80
universities
across
the
country
have
the
right
to
select
talented
students
based
on
their
own
exams
.
 
Education
experts
regard
universities
selecting
students
according
to
independent
examinations
as
conducive
to
better
understanding
where
the
students
'
talents
lie
.
 
Although
this
may
be
the
case
,
it
has
also
created
problems
as
students
may
sit
many
different
exams
as
they
often
apply
for
a
number
of
universities
.
 
To
relieve
students
from
such
pressures
,
the
national
education
outline
(
2010
--
2020
)
released
in
July
this
year
encourages
high-level
universities
to
group
together
to
use
the
same
exams

"To
a
large
degree
,
the
measure
of
our
peace
of
mind
is
determined
by
how
much
we
are
able
to
live
in
the
present
moment
.
Regardless
of
what
happened
yesterday
or
last
year
,
and
what
may
or
may
not
happen
tomorrow
,
the
present
moment
is
where
you
are
--
always
!
 
We
allow
past
problems
and
future
concerns
to
control
our
present
moments
,
so
much
that
we
end
up
anxious
,
frustrated
,
depressed
,
and
hopeless
.
We
often
convince
ourselves
future
will
be
better
than
today
.
John
Lennon
once
said
,
""
Life
is
what
's
happening
while
we
're
busy
making
other
plans
.
""
When
we
're
busy
making
other
plans
""
,
our
children
are
busy
growing
up
,
the
people
we
love
are
moving
away
and
dying
,
our
bodies
are
getting
out
of
shape
,
and
our
dreams
are
slipping
away
.
In
short
,
we
miss
out
on
life
.
 
Many
people
live
as
if
life
were
a
dress
rehearsal
for
some
later
date
.
It
is
n't
.
In
fact
,
no
one
has
a
guarantee
that
he
or
she
will
be
here
tomorrow
.
Now
is
the
only
time
we
have
,
and
the
only
time
that
we
have
any
control
over
.
When
our
attention
is
in
the
present
moment
,
we
push
fear
from
our
minds
.
Fear
is
the
concern
over
events
that
might
happen
in
the
future
--
we
wo
n't
have
enough
money
,
our
children
will
get
into
trouble
,
we
will
get
old
and
die
,
whatever
.
 
To
struggle
against
fear
,
the
best
strategy
is
to
learn
to
bring
your
attention
back
to
the
present
.
Mark
Twain
said
,
""
I
have
been
through
some
terrible
things
in
my
life
,
some
of
which
actually
happened
.
""
I
do
n't
think
I
can
say
it
any
better
.
Practice
keeping
your
attention
on
the
here
and
now
and
your
efforts
will
pay
off

"The
man
sitting
opposite
Robert
was
the
Financial
Controller
.
Everybody
called
him
""
the
FC
""
for
short
.
He
made
all
the
decisions
about
money
.
Robert
needed
some
more
.
That
was
why
he
had
to
see
him
.
The
two
men
did
not
get
on
very
well
.
In
fact
,
they
had
always
disliked
each
other
.
 
""
Your
request
is
out
of
the
question
,
""
the
FC
said
.
Robert
had
difficulty
in
controlling
himself
,
but
he
managed
somehow
.
He
explained
that
he
wanted
the
money
in
order
to
make
more
programmes
.
 
""
And
why
do
you
want
to
do
that
?
""
the
FC
asked
sharply
.
Again
,
Robert
almost
lost
his
temper
.
""
Because
more
and
more
people
are
listening
to
my
department
's
programmes
.
There
's
great
demand
for
them
,
""
he
answered
.
 
The
FC
did
not
seem
to
believe
him
.
But
Robert
had
a
report
on
the
numbers
of
listeners
to
all
EBC
programmes
.
The
FC
became
less
confident
.
Robert
threw
the
report
down
on
the
table
and
told
him
to
read
it
.
 
The
FC
looked
at
it
in
silence
.
The
figures
proved
that
he
had
been
wrong
,
but
he
did
not
want
to
admit
it
.
""
Well
,
""
he
finally
said
,
""
I
may
have
made
a
small
mistake
.
""
Robert
noticed
the
word
""
may
.
""
He
got
up
to
leave
.
But
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
would
get
the
money
after
all
."	"1

"When
was
the
last
time
you
did
something
really
fun
with
one
of
your
parents
--
just
the
two
of
you
?
 
Parents
who
take
their
young
children
to
music
,
swimming
and
art
classes
often
stop
arranging
such
activities
once
their
kids
are
older
and
in
school
all
day
.
But
it
does
n't
have
to
be
that
way
.
Doing
something
enjoyable
with
your
kids
just
might
make
you
look
at
each
other
in
a
whole
new
way
,
especially
if
you
do
it
through
a
class
or
an
event
.
When
parent
and
child
become
students
together
,
it
puts
them
on
the
same
level
,
at
least
for
a
while
.
 
""
I
really
like
parents
to
come
to
class
with
their
kids
--
they
start
sharing
things
and
talking
about
what
they
're
doing
and
what
they
like
,
""
said
art
teacher
Pyper
Dixon
.
 
However
,
finding
something
new
in
common
is
a
big
choice
for
them
,
especially
when
kids
get
involved
in
sports
and
other
after-school
activities
.
But
it
's
possible
to
learn
a
new
skill
or
hobby
together
.
 
That
's
certainly
true
of
Lauren
,
11
,
of
Silver
Spring
,
who
is
in
Dixon
's
class
with
her
father
,
Dennis
.
""
I
was
just
going
to
drop
her
off
,
""
Dennis
said
,
""
but
Dixon

We
have

Without

they
talk

"People
appear
to
be
born
to
calculate
.
The
numerical
skills
of
children
develop
so
early
that
it
is
easy
to
imagine
an
internal
clock
of
mathematical
maturity
guiding
their
growth
.
Not
long
after
learning
to
walk
and
talk
,
they
can
set
the
table
with
impressive
accuracy
--
one
plate
,
one
knife
,
one
spoon
,
one
fork
for
each
of
the
five
chairs
.
Soon
they
are
capable
of
noting
that
they
have
placed
five
knives
,
spoons
and
forks
on
the
table
,
and
a
bit
later
,
that
this
amounts
to
fifteen
pieces
of
silverware
.
Having
thus
mastered
addition
,
some
people
expect
that
if
a
child
were
on
a
desert
island
at
birth
and
brought
back
seven
years
later
,
he
or
she
could
enter
a
second-grade
mathematics
class
without
any
serious
problems
of
intellectual
adjustment
.
 
Of
course
,
the
truth
is
not
so
simple
.
This
century
,
the
work
of
psychologists
has
cast
light
on
the
unnoticeable
forms
of
daily
learning
on
which
intellectual
progress
depends
.
Children
were
observed
as
they
slowly
grasped
--
or
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
came
across
--
concepts
that
adults
take
for
granted
,
as
they
refused
,
for
instance
,
to
admit
that
quantity
is
unchanged
as
water
pours
from
a
short
thick
glass
into
a
tall
thin
one
.
Psychologists
have
since
proved
that
young
children
,
asked
to
count
the
pencils
in
a
pile
,
readily
report
the
number
of
blue
or
red
pencils
,
but
must
be
persuaded
into
finding
the
total
.
Such
studies
have
suggested
that
the
most
basic
parts
of
mathematics
are
mastered
gradually
,
and
with
effort
.
They
have
also
suggested
that
the
very
concept
of
abstract
numbers
--
the
idea
of
a
oneness
,
a
twoness
,
a
threeness
that
applies
to
any
class
of
object
and
is
a
prerequisite
for
doing
anything
more
mathematically
demanding
than
setting
a
table
--
is
itself
far
from
natural
born

"Top
student
Lin
Yijian
had
a
problem
recently
.
The
14-year-old
boy
from
Xiamen
used
to
get
marks
of
over
110
points
(
out
of
120
possible
points
)
on
his
math
tests
.
But
during
last
semester
's
final
exams
,
his
math
score
was
only
90
points
.
 
It
was
a
shock
.
""
I
did
n't
know
what
happened
,
""
said
Lin
,
who
kept
feeling
nervous
and
frustrated
about
math
during
the
following
month
.
 
Like
Lin
,
many
of
us
have
setbacks
in
life
.
What
would
you
do
to
deal
with
these
setbacks
?
Would
you
just
let
them
be
and
give
up
?
 
Lin
chose
to
face
his
problem
.
His
parents
and
teacher
also
gave
him
help
.
After
some
hard
work
he
now
gets
marks
between
100
and110
points
on
his
math
tests
.
Although
he
still
is
n't
at
his
original
level
,
Lin
does
n't
panic
anymore
.
 
""
Do
n't
be
scared
by
setbacks
,
""
he
said
.
""
You
will
beat
it
.
""
 
Chen
Xingzhu
in
Shenzhen
also
has
a
story
to
tell
.
The
15-year-old
girl
is
not
good
at
doing
sit-ups
,
which
is
necessary
for
the
coming
high
school
PE
entrance
exam
.
One
has
to
do
at
least
35
sit-ups
in
a
minute
to
pass
the
test
.
Most
of
Chen
's
classmates
can
do
40
.
However
,
Chen
could
only
do
20
.
 
Feeling
worried
,
Chen
decided
to
do
something
.
She
did
sit-ups
for
half
an
hour
every
day
after
school
.
Now
,
after
a
month
,
she
can
do
30
sit-ups
a
minute
.
 
""
I
finally
found
what
made
me
slow
through
continuous
practice
and
then
improved
little
by
little
,
""
said
Chen
.
""
I
believe
next
month
I
will
be
able
to
do
40
!

"How
much
should
you
save
?
You
may
be
able
to
save
100
%
of
your
money
.
Does
that
mean
you
should
?
Not
at
all
.
The
best
way
to
develop
good
saving
habits
is
to
make
saving
a
regular
part
of
your
life
,
along
with
spending
.
 
Here
is
the
rule
you
should
remember
:
save
before
spending
.
Whenever
some
money
gets
into
your
hands
,
from
a
job
or
your
pocket
money
or
whatever
,
take
your
savings
out
immediately
,
before
spending
any
of
the
money
.
The
beauty
of
this
system
is
that
if
you
take
away
your
savings
,
you
are
free
to
spend
the
rest
.
 
Here
are
some
more
suggestions
on
how
to
successfully
get
into
the
saving
habit
from
teens
.
Let
's
see
!
 
Tony,13
:
I
put
my
money
in
a
bank
instead
of
my
wallet
,
so
the
money
is
not
there
.
And
I
have
to
take
an
extra
step
to
get
it
.
 
Bill,14
:
When
considering
a
major
purchase
,
wait
a
week
or
so
,
at
least
.
This
will
help
you
make
sure
if
you
still
want
it
,
and
the
price
might
go
down
.
 
Dick
,
13
:
Carry
very
little
money
always
.
You
ca
n't
spend
money
if
you
do
n't
have
it
.
A
cake
would
be
nice
,
but
without
a
dollar
,
you
ca
n't
get
it
.
Little
things
like
that
really
add
up
quickly
.
 
Steve,16
:
I
used
to
be
weak
when
it
came
to
money
.
I
bought
something
whenever
I
went
into
a
store
.
I
'm
glad
I
'm
not
that
person
now
.
I
taught
myself
discipline
by
keeping
a
$
20
bill
in
my
pocket
while
waking
around
the
mall
all
day
and
not
buying
anything
.
Now
I
have
no
strong
wish
to
buy
things
when
I
go
into
a
store
.
It
works
for
me
.
 
These
ideas
should
help
you
get
started
.
If
you
have
some
questions
about
anything
you
've
read
here
,
or
would
like
to
share
your
ideas
about
saving
money

"It
was
the
summer
of
1936
.
The
Olympic
Games
were
being
held
in
Berlin
.
I
had
trained
,
sweated
and
disciplined
myself
for
6
years
on
the
running
broad
jump
.
A
year
before
,
as
a
college
student
at
the
Ohio
State
,
I
'd
set
the
world
's
record
of
26
feet
8
1/4
inches
.
Nearly
everyone
expected
me
to
win
.
 
I
was
in
for
a
surprise
.
When
the
time
came
for
the
broad-jump
trials
,
I
was
shocked
to
see
a
tall
boy
hitting
the
pit
at
almost
26
feet
on
his
practice
leaps
.
He
turned
out
to
be
a
German
named
Luz
Long
.
He
had
easily
qualified
for
the
finals
on
his
first
attempt
.
 
A
nervous
athlete
is
an
athlete
who
will
make
mistakes
.
I
fouled
twice
on
my
qualifying
jumps
.
Walking
a
few
yards
from
the
pit
,
I
kicked
at
the
dirt
disgustedly
.
Suddenly
I
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
I
turned
to
look
into
the
friendly
blue
eyes
of
Luz
Long
.
""
Hi
,
I
'm
Luz
Long
.
I
do
n't
think
we
've
met
.
""
""
Glad
to
meet
you
,
""
I
said
.
Then
,
trying
to
hide
my
nervousness
,
I
added
,
""
How
are
you
?
""
""
I
'm
fine
.
Something
must
be
eating
you
.
You
should
be
able
to
qualify
with
your
eyes
closed
.
""
He
said
.
 
He
seemed
to
understand
my
nervousness
,
and
took
pains
to
reassure
me
.
Finally
,
seeing
that
I
had
calmed
down
somewhat
,
he
said
,
""
What
does
it
matter
if
you
're
not
the
first
in
the
trials
?
Tomorrow
is
what
counts
.
""
All
the
tension
left
my
body
as
the
truth
of
what
he
said
hit
me
.
Confidently
I
qualified
with
almost
a
foot
to
spare
.
 
Luz
broke
his
own
record
and
pushed
me
on
to
a
peak
performance
.
The
instant
I
landed
from
my
final
jump
--
the
one
which
set
the
Olympic
record
of
26
feet
5
1/16
inches
--
he
was
at
my
side
,
congratulating
me

"The
Pew
report
,
which
was
based
on
surveys
carried
out
in
Britain
,
France
,
Germany
,
Italy
,
Spain
,
Greece
,
Poland
and
the
Czech
Republic
,
said
that
the
European
Union
was
""
the
new
sick
man
of
Europe
""
.
The
percentage
of
Europeans
with
a
good
view
of
the
EU
has
fallen
from
60
percent
last
year
to
45
percent
now
.
 
The
UK
may
be
considered
the
most
Eurosceptic
country
,
but
its
support
for
the
Union
has
barely
changed
in
the
past
1
2
months
,
falling
only
two
points
to
43
percent
.
But
,
France
's
backing
for
the
EU
has
fallen
sharply
,
from
60
percent
last
year
to
41
percent
today
.
 
On
the
question
of
whether
to
remain
in
the
EU
,
46
percent
of
the
British
want
to
leave
the
Union
and
surprisingly
,
the
same
percentage
want
to
stay
.
 
The
Pew
report
's
authors
said
,
""
The
long-term
economic
crisis
has
created
bad
forces
that
are
pulling
the
European
apart
,
making
the
French
away
from
the
Germans
and
the
Germans
away
from
everyone
else
.
The
effort
over
the
past
half
century
to
create
a
more
united
Europe
is
now
the
main
disaster
of
the
euro
crisis
.
""
 
The
only
European
leader
supported
highly
by
their
own
voters
was
the
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
,
with
74
percent
voters
.
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
was
the
next
highest
with
a
positive
score
of
37
percent
among
the
British
public
,
and
he
can
take
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
58
percent
of
the
Poles
and
half
of
all
French
people
think
he
is
doing
a
good
job
.
 
Besides
the
dark
economic
future
and
the
growing
question
of
the
EU
,
there
were
more
than
60
percent
in
favor
of
keeping
it

"The
resignation
letter
of
Gu
Shaoqiang
,
a
teacher
from
Henan
,
""
The
world
is
so
big
;
I
want
to
see
it
.
""
is
very
popular
in
the
Internet
.
Many
people
say
that
it
spoke
the
minds
of
millions
of
people
who
feel
they
have
been
in
a
boring
and
normal
life
and
want
to
do
something
different
to
change
it
.
Whatever
the
teacher
may
be
able
to
achieve
with
her
life
,
it
is
meaningful
for
people
to
make
their
dream
come
true
.
 
So
,
what
is
your
opinion
?
Should
we
praise
the
teacher
for
resigning
and
following
her
dreams
?
 
Yes
--
-All
of
us
have
dreams
that
ca
n't
come
true
right
now
.
 
First
,
Too
many
people
waste
their
lives
by
doing
things
they
do
n't
love
simply
because
it
is
what
people
expect
them
to
do
.
They
are
not
happy
and
they
also
affect
people
around
them
.
The
earlier
they
can
break
free
,
the
more
meaning
they
can
make
out
of
their
lives
.
 
Second
,
It
is
a
waste
of
people
's
talents
and
social
resources
if
they
do
n't
get
to
do
the
things
they
are
most
talented
at
.
Some
people
do
n't
want
to
be
white-collar
workers
all
their
lives
.
They
should
have
the
freedom
to
change
their
lives
.
 
Third
,
As
our
country
develops
so
fast
,
people
have
greater
freedom
to
change
their
lives
as
long
as
they
put
in
the
time
and
effort
.
The
teacher
is
a
good
example
.
 
No
--
-People
ca
n't
change
their
lives
overnight
.
 
First
,
""
Seeing
the
world
""
is
not
good
enough
an
excuse
to
leave
one
's
job
and
life
.
This
kind
of
attitude
could
actually
be
a
bad
example
for
young
people
.
 
Second
,
Everyone
has
a
place
in
society
and
life
.
People
may
not
have
achieved
their
wildest
or
most
ambitious
dreams
,
but
where
they
end
up
is
the
result
of
their
and
society
's
decisions
.
Unless
they
offer
to
make
lots
of
efforts
and
sacrifices
,
people
ca
n't
change
their
lives
overnight
.
 
Third
,
The
reason
why
the
teacher
gave
up
her
job
is
too
unclear
.
It
is
too
irresponsible

"It
is
well-known
that
the
""
prom
""
,
a
formal
dance
held
at
the
end
of
high
school
or
college
,
is
an
important
date
in
every
student
's
life
.
What
is
less
well-known
is
that
the
word
""
prom
""
comes
from
the
verb
""
to
promenade
""
,
which
means
to
walk
around
,
beautifully
dressed
,
in
order
to
attract
attention
.
The
idea
is
that
you
should
see
and
be
seen
by
others
.
 
The
prom
is
not
just
an
American
tradition
,
though
most
people
believe
that
it
started
in
America
.
In
Canada
the
event
is
called
a
""
formal
""
.
In
Britain
and
Australia
the
old
fashioned
word
""
dance
""
is
more
and
more
frequently
being
referred
to
as
a
""
prom
""
.
Most
countries
have
some
form
of
celebration
when
students
finish
high
school
:
after
all
,
it
means
the
end
of
life
as
a
child
,
and
the
beginning
of
life
as
an
adult
.
 
The
prom
is
expensive
to
organize
and
the
tickets
can
cost
students
a
lot
of
money
.
The
tradition
is
that
students
themselves
have
to
raise
the
money
to
pay
for
it
.
Selling
the
students
newspapers
is
one
way
to
raise
money
;
so
is
taking
a
part-time
job
at
the
weekend
.
 
Although
the
prom
should
be
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
,
it
also
worries
many
students
.
There
is
the
problem
of
what
to
wear
,
who
to
take
as
your
partner
,
who
will
be
voted
""
prom
queen
""
,
etc
.
And
it
is
not
only
students
who
feel
worried
.
What
many
parents
find
difficult
is
the
realization
that
their
children
's
school
days
are
almost
over
.
However
,
for
most
people
at
the
prom
,
once
the
music
starts
playing
,
everyone
relaxes
and
stops
worrying

"CHICAGO
--
--
For
working
parents
and
heavily
scheduled
school
kids
,
family
mealtime
is
out
of
fashion
.
But
supermarkets
are
trying
to
attract
families
back
to
the
dinner
table
.
 
There
is
a
cost
if
family
members
have
meals
apart
:
research
shows
that
teenagers
who
do
n't
eat
with
their
parents
face
a
greater
risk
of
drug
and
alcohol
problems
.
 
""
The
more
often
kids
have
dinner
with
their
parents
,
the
less
likely
they
are
to
smoke
,
drink
or
use
drugs
,
""
said
Joseph
Califano
Jr.
,
head
of
the
National
Center
on
Addiction
and
Substance
Abuse
,
which
did
the
research
.
 
Stores
are
familiar
with
the
idea
and
will
start
telling
shoppers
about
the
findings
and
encouraging
them
to
share
meals
together
at
home
,
instead
of
separately
or
at
restaurants
.
 
The
food
marketing
Institute
will
give
$
25,000
to
the
center
and
help
stores
promote
the
center
's
Family
Day
in
September
.
 
Many
stores
have
grab-and-go
dinners
and
recipe
cards
.
Some
have
kiosks
where
people
can
taste
a
main
dish
,
then
pick
out
side
dishes
.
 
""
Our
members
have
worked
hard
to
try
to
have
easily
prepared
food
either
ready
to
eat
or
ready
to
take
home
,
""
said
Tim
Hammonds
,
the
institute
's
president
and
chief
executive
.
 
Los
Angeles-based
Contessa
Premium
Foods
makes
frozen
delicious
meals
,
which
a
family
can
heat
in
10
minutes
to
12
minutes
.
""
That
's
nearly
as
fast
as
a
TV
dinner
,
""
said
president
and
chief
executive
John
Z.
Blazevich
,
""
but
is
healthier
and
makes
people
feel
like
they
actually
cooked
.
""
 
""
The
preparation
is
the
hardest
part
,
so
we
try
to
combine
a
variety
of
tastes
and
flavours
from
around
the
world
and
make
it
fast
and
easy
,
""
he
said
.
 
""
Eating
at
home
helps
keep
meals
healthy
and
teaches
kids
how
to
eat
right
.
If
we
can
get
people
back
to
having
family
dinners
,
parents
back
to
being
engaged
with
their
kids
,
it
will
have
a
surprising
impact
,

"You
could
feel
sorry
for
Alberto
Torres
,
who
is
blind
.
The
last
thing
he
remembers
seeing
was
his
daughter
being
born
13
years
ago
.
Then
the
world
went
blank
;
he
can
only
imagine
what
his
only
child
looks
like
now
,
as
a
teenaged
honor
student
.
Bad
luck
is
no
stranger
to
this
warm
and
thoughtful
37-year-old
man
.
His
mother
died
of
cancer
when
he
was
4
,
and
his
father
,
who
was
often
ill
,
had
to
give
him
up
to
the
care
of
the
state
when
he
was
11
.
He
later
worked
for
19
years
in
a
workshop
making
household
goods
,
deathly
boring
work
.
Earlier
this
month
,
Alberto
Torres
's
wife
,
who
had
just
been
laid
off
from
her
job
,
had
to
have
a
breast
removed
due
to
cancer
and
now
faces
a
year
of
radiation
treatments
.
Things
seemed
always
to
go
from
almost
incredibly
bad
to
worse
.
Even
Mr.
Torres
's
good
luck
has
a
dark
side
:
Five
years
ago
,
his
lovely
guide
dog
pulled
him
out
of
the
path
of
a
truck
.
Mr.
Torres
was
not
hurt
.
The
dog
was
killed
.
 
But
Mr.
Torres
does
not
feel
sorry
for
himself
.
""
These
are
just
little
bumps
you
have
to
go
over
in
your
life
,
""
he
said
.
At
5
a.m.
on
a
recent
morning
,
we
caught
up
with
Mr.
Torres
at
a
subway
stop
in
Brooklyn
,
New
York
,
near
where
he
lives
in
a
third-floor
apartment
(
with
no
elevator
)
.
He
had
been
up
since
3
a.m.
,
feeding
his
new
dog
,
making
coffee
,
getting
ready
.
""
When
you
're
blind
,
it
takes
a
little
longer
to
do
things
,
""
he
said
.
 
Mr.
Torres
was
beginning
his
two-hour
trip
to
his
job
developing
film
in
the
X-ray
department
of
the
emergency
room
of
the
Bronx
hospital
.
He
would
take
the
G
train
to
Queens
Plaza
station
to
the
R
train
,
heading
towards
Manhattan
.
He
would
then
ride
the
R
train
to
59th
Street
where
he
would
walk
upstairs
to
switch
to
the
Number
6
train
.
At
one
point
along
the
journey
,
he
might
chat
with
a
stranger
.
At
another
,
someone
would
pat
his
dog
,
calling
him
by
name
.
People
offered
assistance
,
even
seats
.
At
125th
Street
,
Mr.
Torres
would
transfer
to
the
Number
4
train
by
crossing
the
platform
.
At
149th
Street
,
he
would
go
down
to
the
Number
2
.
He
would
take
that
to
East
180th
Street
where
he
nearly
always
has
a
long
wait
for
his
final
train
,
to
Pelham
Parkway
.
Then
he
and
his
dog
would
walk
20
minutes
to
the
hospital
.
 
It
was
a
hard
job
to
come
by
.
Before
he
got
the
job
,
Mr.
Torres
was
determined
to
escape
the
workshop
run
by
an
organization
dedicated
to
help
people
who
ca
n't
see
.
He
wanted
a
job
developing
X-ray
film
,
something
that
everyone
must
do
in
the
dark
.
He
had
to
handle
the
long
trip
,
as
well
as
the
work
.
""
Our
philosophy
here
is
that
blind
people
can
do
just
about
anything
except
drive
buses
,
""
it
was
the
thinking
about
disabled
people
at
the
Bronx
hospital
.
""
We
find
what
a
person
can
do
rather
than
what
he
ca
n't
do
,
""
said
the
hospital
's
director
.
 
One
day
a
while
ago
marked
the
first
anniversary
of
Mr.
Torres
's
hiring
.
He
developed
150
or
so
X-rays
,
his
usual
output
,
to
celebrate
.
Mr.
Torres
works
by
himself
in
a
small
,
dark
room
that
smells
of
chemicals
.
He
can
not
wear
gloves
,
because
he
needs
to
feel
.
It
is
hard
work
,
related
to
emergency
of
lives
.
His
immediate
supervisor
says
he
trusts
him
100
%
.
Mr.
Torres
makes
$
20,000
a
year
.
But
his
motivation
goes
beyond
money
.
""
If
I
start
feeling
like
a
victim
,
that
makes
me
bitter
.
And
why
be
bitter
?
That
makes
you
go
into
a
hole
and
stay
there
.
""
he
said
.
""
I
'm
not
doing
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
,
""
insisted
Mr.
Torres
as
he
quickly
completed
the
task
."	"1

"Jenny
went
to
visit
her
friends
in
New
York
last
weekend
.
Her
friends
met
her
at
the
airport
on
Friday
afternoon
and
drove
her
to
the
hotel
.
They
had
dinner
at
a
Chinese
restaurant
and
went
to
see
a
film
after
that
.
 
Jenny
and
her
friends
set
out
early
on
Saturday
morning
for
a
farm
and
stayed
there
until
Sunday
morning
.
During
their
stay
,
they
went
fishing
and
swimming
in
the
small
river
on
the
farm
.
They
played
football
in
the
field
and
enjoyed
a
big
meal
around
a
camp
fire
,
singing
and
dancing
till
late
into
the
night
.
 
Nobody
could
get
up
early
on
Sunday
morning
.
So
when
they
got
back
to
New
York
City
,
it
was
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
They
drove
right
to
the
airport
because
Jenny
did
n't
want
to
miss
her
plane
back
home
.
Jenny
only
stayed
in
New
York
for
two
nights
but
she
had
a
great
time
with
her
friends

"Soon
Tommy
's
parents
,
who
had
recently
separated
,
would
arrive
for
a
conference
on
his
failing
schoolwork
and
bad
behavior
.
Neither
parent
knew
that
I
had
called
the
other
.
 
Tommy
,
an
only
child
,
had
always
been
happy
,
cooperative
and
an
excellent
student
.
How
could
I
convince
his
father
and
mother
that
his
recent
failing
grades
represented
a
broken-hearted
child
's
reaction
to
his
parents
'
separation
and
pending
divorce
?
 
Tommy
's
mother
entered
and
took
one
of
the
chairs
.
Soon
the
father
arrived
.
Good
!
At
least
they
were
concerned
enough
to
be
here
in
time
.
They
ignored
each
other
.
 
As
I
gave
a
detailed
account
of
Tommy
's
behavior
and
schoolwork
,
I
prayed
for
the
right
words
to
bring
these
two
together
to
help
them
see
what
they
were
doing
to
their
son
.
But
somehow
the
words
would
n't
come
.
Perhaps
if
they
saw
one
of
his
dirty
,
carelessly
done
papers
?
 
I
found
a
sheet
in
the
back
of
his
desk
.
Writing
covered
both
sides
:
not
the
assignment
,
but
a
single
sentence
scribbled
over
and
over
.
 
Silently
I
gave
it
to
Tommy
's
mother
.
She
read
it
and
then
handed
it
to
her
husband
.
Then
his
face
softened
.
 
At
last
he
folded
the
paper
carefully
,
placed
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
reached
for
his
wife
's
hand
.
She
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
smiled
up
at
him
.
He
helped
her
with
her
coat
and
they
left
together
.
 
In
his
own
way
God
had
given
me
the
words
to
reunite
that
family
.
He
had
guided
me
to
the
sheet
of
yellow
copy
paper
covered
with
the
pain
out
pouring
of
a
small
boy
's
troubled
heart
.
 
The
words
are
""
Dear
Mom
...
Dear
Daddy
...
I
love
you
...

"Soon
after
you
have
your
first
child
,
the
question
of
having
a
second
one
is
raised
by
friends
and
family
.
However
,
as
the
pattern
of
having
two
children
in
a
family
is
challenged
by
modern
family
units
,
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
it
is
not
selfish
to
want
only
one
child
.
 
Today
,
the
role
of
women
has
changed
a
lot
.
But
nowadays
,
a
wife
has
to
help
her
husband
earn
the
bread
and
butter
as
well
as
well
as
looking
after
her
family
.
In
demanding
times
like
these
,
a
woman
has
to
put
in
more
physical
and
emotional
effort
than
any
other
member
of
the
family
.
 
Raising
a
child
comes
at
a
cost
that
remains
only
heard
of
,
until
you
find
yourself
paying
it
.
The
good
reality
of
double
income
with
no
kids
suddenly
comes
crashing
down
when
there
is
a
child
involved
in
the
picture
.
When
one
parent
(
the
mother
)
needs
to
take
some
time
off
to
look
after
the
newborn
,
only
one
person
becomes
the
earning
member
.
Of
course
,
the
expenses
went
up
rapidly
.
According
to
Susan
Newman
,
PhD
,
a
social
psychologist
,
the
average
cost
of
raising
a
child
is
$
227,000
from
birth
to
college
.
 
Most
young
mothers
also
think
that
having
one
child
would
mean
that
there
is
more
income
for
the
child
,
and
thus
,
better
facilities
can
be
provided
.
It
is
much
easier
to
educate
a
single
child
at
a
good
school
,
and
give
him/her
better
life
with
more
resources
at
hand
.
 
With
several
children
in
the
house
,
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
to
find
ways
to
spend
time
with
all
of
them
.
Dividing
your
time
with
just
one
child
means
that
you
can
devote
a
little
more
time
to
doing
the
things
you
want
to
.
In
a
single
child
unit
,
there
are
less
comparison
and
more
chances
for
positive
motivation
to
learn
new
things
.
A
happy
child
,
who
deserves
the
rightful
attention
,
love
,
care
,
and
time
from
both
the
parents
,
always
gets
a
meaningful
childhood
,
for
both
the
parents
and
the
child
."	"383

"Crazy
is
our
new
normal
.
With
two
teenage
boys
and
three
little
boys
,
our
family
is
restless
--
to
the
baseball
field
,
track
field
and
piano
lessons
.
Even
though
we
've
limited
each
boy
's
activities
and
try
our
best
to
defend
our
family
time
,
it
seems
that
we
're
in
a
constant
state
of
flight
.
 
""
Embrace
it
.
Roll
with
it
,
""
my
husband
,
Lonny
,
says
,
""
It
's
going
to
be
like
this
for
a
while
.
""
 
He
is
right
.
It
's
likely
that
life
will
continue
to
go
forward
before
it
slows
down
.
But
I
remembered
the
still
,
quiet
days
that
our
family
used
to
enjoy
.
I
missed
long
walks
through
the
park
when
we
held
the
boys
'
little
hands
.
I
longed
for
lazy
Saturday
afternoons
under
the
tree
in
our
backyard
.
I
wanted
to
slip
back
a
few
years
,
when
busyness
was
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
.
 
One
night
,
after
a
particularly
full
day
and
evening
games
,
our
family
gathered
on
the
porch
for
ice
cream
.
Two
parents
,
two
teens
,
and
three
small
boys
piled
on
one
old
swing
and
a
couple
of
rocking
chairs
.
We
were
together
,
in
one
place
,
for
a
small
slice
of
time
.
 
The
moon
was
full
.
The
Mississippi
River
,
flowing
past
our
home
,
was
smooth
as
glass
.
I
wrapped
my
own
arms
around
the
son
who
sat
on
my
lap
and
breathed
deeply
to
inhale
his
little-boy
scent
--
dirt
and
sweat
.
My
heart
was
still
and
content
.
 
I
realized
that
while
crazy
is
our
new
normal
happiness
is
as
usual
.
They
may
look
different
from
before
,
but
they
are
still
there
--
even
if
they
're
in
the
form
of
a
single
moment
on
the
porch
.
Maybe
I
just
need
the
eyes
to
see

"Most
lives
saved
from
sinking
ferryCao
Min
could
n't
believe
she
was
experiencing
exactly
what
she
had
seen
years
ago
in
the
film
""
Titanic
""
.
 
Cao
and
her
two
children
from
Anhui
Province
were
traveling
on
board
the
""
Liaoludu
7
""
on
February
22
.
They
were
among
the
first
people
on
the
ship
who
were
rescued
by
lifeboats
.
Cao
's
one-year-old
son
was
the
youngest
passenger
on
board
.
 
The
""
Liaoludu
7
""
was
traveling
in
the
Bohai
Straits
from
Lushun
in
Liaoning
Province
to
the
port
city
of
Longkou
in
Shandong
Province
.
It
suddenly
lost
its
power
at
2:30
pm
and
tilted
on
its
side
.
With
81
people
on
board
,
the
ferry
began
to
sink
.
 
""
I
was
so
scared
that
my
legs
could
n't
move
forward
.
They
kept
shaking
even
when
I
was
asked
to
jump
onto
a
""
lifeboat
.
""
Cao
recalled
.
 
Upon
receiving
the
urgent
appeal
,
China
Marine
Search
and
Rescue
Center
immediately
informed
the
State
Council
.
The
center
sent
eight
lifeboats
to
the
sinking
ship
and
asked
for
help
form
the
Ministry
of
Agriculture
,
the
Navy
and
nearby
fishing
boats
.
 
After
more
than
four
hours
of
fighting
against
strong
winds
and
freezing
ocean
water
,
the
passengers
were
recovered
.
All
but
four
survived
.
These
four
died
after
spending
too
long
in
the
freezing
waters
,
according
to
a
spokesperson
for
the
Beijing-based
center
.

"Maybe
ten-year-old
Elizabeth
put
it
best
when
she
said
to
her
father
,
""
But
,
Dad
,
you
ca
n't
be
healthy
if
you
're
dead
.
""
 
Dad
,
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
before
dark
so
he
could
go
for
a
run
,
had
forgotten
to
wear
his
safety
belt
--
a
mistake
75
%
of
the
US
population
make
every
day
.
The
big
question
is
why
.
 
There
have
been
many
myths
about
safety
belts
ever
since
their
first
appearance
in
cars
some
forty
years
ago
.
The
following
are
three
of
the
most
common
.
 
Myth
Number
One
:
It
's
best
to
be
""
thrown
clear
""
of
a
serious
accident
.
 
Truth
:
Sorry
,
but
any
accident
serious
enough
to
""
throw
you
clear
""
is
also
going
to
be
serious
enough
to
give
you
a
very
bad
landing
.
And
chances
are
that
you
'll
have
traveled
through
a
wind
shield
or
door
to
do
it
.
Studies
show
that
chances
of
dying
after
a
car
accident
are
twenty-five
times
greater
in
cases
where
people
are
""
thrown
clear
""
.
 
Myth
Number
Two
:
Safety
belts
""
trap
""
people
in
cars
that
are
burning
or
sinking
in
water
.
 
Truth
:
Sorry
again
,
but
studies
show
that
people
knocked
unconscious
due
to
not
wearing
safety
belts
have
a
greater
chance
of
dying
in
these
accidents
.
People
wearing
safety
belts
are
usually
protected
to
the
point
of
having
a
clear
head
to
free
themselves
from
such
dangerous
situations
,
not
to
be
trapped
in
them
.
 
Myth
Number
Three
:
Safety
belts
are
n't
needed
at
speeds
of
less
than
30
miles
per
hour
.
 
Truth
:
When
two
cars
traveling
at
30
mph
hit
each
other
,
an
unbelted
driver
would
meet
the
windshield
with
a
force
equal
to
diving
headfirst
into
the
ground
from
a
height
of
10
meters

"What
will
higher
education
look
like
in
2050
?
That
was
the
question
addressed
Tuesday
night
by
Michael
Crow
,
president
of
Arizona
State
University
.
 
""
We
're
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
wave
of
change
in
higher
education
,
""
Crow
began
,
arguing
that
research
universities
followed
the
initial
establishment
of
higher
education
,
public
colleges
,
and
land-grant
schools
in
the
timeline
of
America
.
 
In
less
than
a
half-century
,
he
said
,
global
market
competition
will
be
at
its
fastest
rates
of
change
ever
,
with
several
multitrillion-dollar
economies
worldwide
.
According
to
a
recent
projection
,
the
nation
's
population
could
reach
435
million
,
with
a
large
percentage
of
those
residents
economically
disadvantaged
.
In
addition
,
climate
change
will
be
""
meaningfully
uncontrollable
""
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.
 
The
everyday
trends
seen
today
,
such
as
declining
performance
of
students
at
all
levels
,
particularly
in
math
and
science
,
and
declining
wages
and
employment
among
the
less
educated
,
will
only
continue
,
Crow
maintained
,
and
are
,
to
say
the
least
,
not
contributing
to
fulfilling
the
dream
of
climbing
the
social
ladder
mobility
,
quality
of
life
,
sustainable
environment
,
and
longer
life
spans
that
most
Americans
share
.
 
""
How
is
it
that
we
can
have
these
great
research
universities
and
have
negative-trending
outcomes
?
""
Crow
said
in
a
talk
""
I
hold
the
universities
accountable
.
...
We
are
part
of
the
problem
.
""
 
Among
the
""
things
that
we
do
that
make
the
things
that
we
teach
less
learnable
,
""
Crow
said
,
are
the
strict
separation
of
disciplines
,
academic
rigidity
,
and
conservatism
,
the
desire
of
universities
to
imitate
schools
at
the
top
of
the
social
ranks
,
and
the
lack
of
the
computer
system
ability
that
would
allow
a
large
number
of
students
to
be
educated
for
a
small
amount
of
money
.
 
Since
2002
,
when
Crow
started
being
in
charge
at
Arizona
State
--
which
he
calls
the
""
new
American
university
""
--
he
has
led
more
than
three
dozen
initiatives
that
aim
to
make
the
school
""
inclusive
,
scalable
,
fast
,
adaptive
,
challenge-focused
,
and
willing
to
take
risks
.
""
 
Among
those
initiatives
were
a
restructuring
of
the
engineering
and
life
sciences
schools
to
create
more
linkages
between
disciplines
;
the
launch
of
the
School
of
Earth
and
Space
Exploration
and
the
School
of
Sustainability
;
the
start
of
a
Teachers
College
to
address
K-12
performance
and
increase
the
status
of
the
Education
Department
at
the
university
;
and
broadened
access
,
increasing
the
freshman
class
size
by
42
percent
and
the
enrollment
of
students
living
below
the
poverty
line
by

""
by

During

Crow
clarified

expanded
on
some
of
his
points
.
He
discussed
,
for
example
,
the
school
's
distance-learning
program
.
""
Nearly

he
said
,
which

the
school
to
keep
costs
down

He
said
that
Arizona
State
is
working
to
increase
the
transfer

students
,
of

only
about
15

"Most
people
think
of
zoos
as
safe
heavens
for
animals
,
where
problems
such
as
difficulty
finding
food
and
avoiding
predators
do
n't
exist
.
Therefore
,
animals
in
zoos
should
live
to
a
ripe
old
age
.
 
But
that
may
not
be
true
for
the
largest
land
animals
on
earth
.
Scientists
have
known
that
elephants
in
zoos
often
suffer
from
poor
health
.
They
develop
diseases
and
they
are
even
unable
to
have
babies
.
 
To
learn
more
about
how
captivity
affects
elephants
,
a
team
of
international
scientists
compared
the
lifespans
of
the
zoo-born
elephants
with
the
lifespans
of
thousands
of
wild
elephants
.
They
also
compared
some
Asian
elephants
living
in
zoos
with
some
Asian
elephants
which
work
in
logging
camp
,
over
almost
the
same
time
period
.
 
The
team
found
that
elephants
born
in
zoos
lived
an
average
of
16.9
years
,
but
elephants
that
died
of
natural
causes
lived
an
average
of
56
years
.
Asian
elephants
followed
a
similar
pattern
.
In
zoos
,
they
lived
18.9
years
,
while
those
in
the
logging
camp
lived
41.7
years
.
 
Scientists
do
n't
yet
know
why
wild
elephants
seem
to
live
so
much
better
than
their
zoo-raised
counterparts
.
Georgia
Mason
,
a
biologist
at
the
University
of
Guelph
in
Canada
,
who
led
the
study
,
thinks
stress
and
obesity
may
be
to
blame
.
Zoo
elephants
do
n't
get
the
same
kind
of
exercise
they
would
in
the
wild
.
Elephants
'
social
lives
are
also
much
different
in
zoos
than
in
the
wild
,
where
they
live
in
large
family
groups

"When
you
are
invited
to
attend
a
party
in
the
West
,
the
first
important
thing
you
need
to
know
is
that
you
should
arrive
late
.
 
It
is
a
great
embarrassment
to
arrive
at
a
party
early
or
even
on
time
.
Therefore
,
unless
you
are
the
host
of
the
party
,
you
never
want
to
be
the
first
person
present
at
a
party
.
Why
?
Because
others
may
think
that
you
have
no
life
or
nothing
better
to
do
than
wait
for
a
party
to
start
.
Many
people
try
to
project
an
image
of
always
being
busy
,
which
,
whether
true
or
not
,
has
something
to
do
with
success
.
So
,
by
arriving
late
,
you
are
implying
:
""
I
live
a
full
life
and
it
's
really
exciting
.
""
 
Therefore
,
an
8
o'clock
party
usually
does
n't
really
start
until
maybe
9
o'clock
,
as
everyone
wants
to
be
thought
of
as
a
busy
and
important
person
with
lots
of
things
to
do
.
In
other
words
,
a
party
is
one
of
those
rare
occasions
in
which
your
punctuality
can
actually
hurt
you
.
It
's
quite
a
strange
thing
,
is
n't
it
?
Anyhow
,
remember
to
be
late
!"	"217

"If
it
really
is
what
's
on
the
inside
that
counts
,
then
a
lot
of
thin
people
might
be
in
trouble
.
 
Some
doctors
now
think
that
the
internal
fat
surrounding
important
organs
like
the
heart
or
liver
could
be
as
dangerous
as
the
external
fat
which
can
be
noticed
more
easily
.
 
""
Being
thin
does
n't
surely
mean
you
are
not
fat
,
""
said
Dr
Jimmy
Bell
at
Imperial
College
.
Since
1994
,
Bell
and
his
team
have
scanned
nearly
800
people
with
MRI
machines
to
create
""
fat
maps
""
showing
where
people
store
fat
.
 
According
to
the
result
,
people
who
keep
their
weight
through
diet
rather
than
exercise
are
likely
to
have
major
deposits
of
internal
fat
,
even
if
they
are
slim
.
 
Even
people
with
normal
Body
Mass
Index
scores
can
have
surprising
levels
of
fat
deposits
inside
.
Of
the
women
,
as
many
as
45
percent
of
those
with
normal
BMI
scores
(
20
to
25
)
actually
had
too
high
levels
of
internal
fat
.
Among
men
,
the
percentage
was
nearly
60
percent
.
 
According
to
Bell
,
people
who
are
fat
on
the
inside
are
actually
on
the
edge
of
being
fat
.
They
eat
too
many
fatty
and
sugary
foods
,
but
they
are
not
eating
enough
to
be
fat
.
Scientists
believe
we
naturally
store
fat
around
the
belly
first
,
but
at
some
point
,
the
body
may
start
storing
it
elsewhere
.
 
Doctors
are
unsure
about
the
exact
dangers
of
internal
fat
,
but
some
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
heart
disease
and
diabetes
.
They
want
to
prove
that
internal
fat
damages
the
body
's
communication
systems
.
 
The
good
news
is
that
internal
fat
can
be
easily
burned
off
through
exercise
or
even
by
improving
your
diet
.
""
If
you
want
to
be
healthy
,
there
is
no
short
cut
.
Exercise
has
to
be
an
important
part
of
your
lifestyle
,

"Some
kinds
of
mental
skills
naturally
decrease
as
people
get
older
.
Yet
research
seems
to
show
that
some
training
can
improve
such
skills
.
A
recently
published
study
also
appears
to
demonstrate
that
the
good
effects
of
training
can
last
for
many
years
after
that
training
has
ended
.
 
Researchers
at
Johns
Hopkins
University
in
Maryland
wanted
to
learn
how
long
memory
and
thinking
skills
would
last
in
older
people
who
trained
to
keep
them
.
The
people
were
part
of
the
ten-year
research
project
.
They
were
taught
methods
meant
to
improve
their
memory
,
thinking
and
ability
to
perform
everyday
tasks
.
 
More
than
2,800
volunteered
for
the
study
called
ACTIVE
-
short
for
Advanced
(
Cognitive
)
Training
for
Independent
and
Vital
Elderly
.
Most
studied
when
they
were
more
than
70
years
old
.
 
The
volunteers
took
one
of
several
short
training
classes
meant
to
help
them
keep
their
mental
abilities
.
One
class
trained
participants
in
skills
including
how
to
remember
word
lists
.
Another
group
trained
in
reasoning
.
A
third
group
received
help
with
speed-of-processing
-
speed
of
receiving
and
understanding
information
.
A
fourth
group
-
the
control
group
did
not
get
any
training
.
 
Earlier
results
had
established
that
the
training
helped
the
participants
for
up
to
five
years
.
Now
,
lead
study
writer
George
Rebok
says
,
the
research
showed
most
of
the
training
remained
effective
a
full
ten
years
later
.
 
Professor
Rebok
and
his
team
found
that
the
people
trained
in
reasoning
and
speed-of-processing
did
better
on
tests
than
the
control
group
.
 
""
We
are
wondering
whether
those
effects
which
endured
over
time
would
still
be
there
ten
years
following
the
training
,
and
in
fact
,
that
's
exactly
what
we
found
.
""
 
The
effect
on
memory
,
however
,
seemed
not
to
last
as
long
.
Still
,
the
old
people
in
any
of
the
three
classes
generally
reported
less
difficulty
in
performing
daily
activities
than
the
control
group
.
The
total
training
time
for
the
older
people
was
between
10
and
15
hours

*Always
stand
when
making
an
introduction
.
 
When
you
are
seated
and
someone
comes
up
to
greet
you
,
make
the
effort
to
stand
up
.
By
doing
this
,
you
show
respect
for
yourself
and
for
the
other
person
.
 
*Always
keep
eye
contact
while
making
an
introduction
.
 
Many
people
are
not
aware
of
the
value
of
this
simple
action
.
When
you
make
eye
contact
,
you
are
giving
a
confident
image
.
 
*Always
introduce
a
person
of
lesser
authority
to
one
of
greater
authority
.
The
most
important
thing
to
remember
is
to
say
the
most
important
person
's
name
first
.
 
For
example
,
when
introducing
your
supervisor
to
a
job
candidate
,
you
would
give
your
supervisor
's
name
first
.
""
Bob
Jones
,
may
I
introduce
Susan
Lee
,
who
has
just
graduated
from
ABC
University
?
""
 
*In
a
situation
where
rank
is
unimportant
,
an
introduction
is
based
on
sex
and
age
.
A
man
is
presented
to
a
woman
and
a
younger
woman
to
an
older
woman
.
 
What
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
situation
where
you
have
forgotten
the
other
person
's
name
?
Start
with
a
handshake
and
reintroduce
yourself
.
When
doing
this
,
you
will
usually
cause
the
other
person
to
do
the
same
.
 
However
,
if
the
other
person
does
not
take
your
suggestion
,
it
is
OK
simply
to
apologize
and
let
the
person
know
that
you
can
not
remember
her
or
his
name
.
This
is
not
the
ideal
situation
,
of
course
,
but
it
does
happen
to
all
of
us
.
The
other
person
should
be
forgiving

"Silk
production
has
a
long
and
colourful
history
unknown
to
most
people
.
Scientific
discoveries
have
shown
that
silk
production
existed
in
China
from
around
2500
B.C.
,
although
it
could
be
much
older
.
For
hundreds
of
years
,
China
kept
the
secret
of
silk
to
itself
as
one
for
the
most
closely
protected
secrets
in
history
.
Anyone
revealing
the
secret
of
silkworms
or
trying
to
take
silkworm
eggs
out
of
ancient
China
was
punished
by
death
.
 
At
one
time
silk
was
reserved
only
for
the
Chinese
emperor
.
Gradually
,
others
began
wearing
silk
.
In
addition
to
being
used
for
clothing
,
silk
came
to
have
industrial
uses
in
ancient
China
,
something
that
happened
in
the
West
only
in
modern
times
.
Silk
was
used
to
make
musical
instruments
,
fishing
lines
,
weapons
,
ropes
and
even
paper
.
During
the
Han
Dynasty
silk
became
a
form
of
money
.
Farmers
paid
taxes
in
both
rice
and
silk
.
The
prices
of
goods
were
calculated
in
lengths
of
silk
just
as
they
had
once
been
calculated
in
gold
.
The
importance
of
silk
is
even
reflected
in
the
Chinese
language
.
For
example
,
of
the
5000
most
common
Chinese
characters
,
around
500
have
silk
as
their
""
key
""
.
 
In
spite
of
their
secrecy
,
the
Chinese
eventually
lost
their
monopoly
on
silk
production
.
It
reached
Korea
in
around
200
B.C
.
when
immigrants
from
China
arrived
there
.
Silk
production
came
to
India
in
300
A.D..
It
was
not
until
500
A.D.
that
silk
production
came
to
Europe
when
travellers
smuggled
out
silkworms
in
hollow
tubes
of
bamboo
.
These
were
used
to
establish
silk
industry
in
Rome
(
modern-day
Italy
)
,
although
Chinese
silk
was
still
considered
to
be
the
best
.
 
Silk
was
brought
to
Rome
from
China
by
means
of
the
Silk
Road
.
There
were
actually
two
Silk
Roads
,
one
over
land
and
one
on
the
sea
.
The
land
route
in
particular
had
a
huge
effect
in
history
.
All
sorts
of
trade
goods
--
silver
,
gold
,
jade
,
porcelain
--
passed
along
this
road
.
Ideas
travelled
the
Silk
Road
too
.
For
example
the
religion
of
Buddhism
was
carried
to
China
from
India
by
traders
on
the
Silk
Road
.
The
Silk
Road
created
the
first
international
culture
,
exposing
many
people
to
the
ideas
and
treasures
of
both
Western
and
Chinese
cultures

"There
was
a
little
boy
with
a
bad
temper
.
His
father
gave
him
some
nails
to
drive
into
the
fence
when
he
lost
his
temper
.
The
first
day
the
boy
drove
37
nails
into
the
fence
.
Then
it
began
to
become
less
.
He
found
it
was
easier
to
hold
his
temper
than
to
drive
those
nails
into
the
fence
.
 
Finally
the
day
came
when
the
boy
did
n't
lose
his
temper
at
all
.
He
told
his
father
about
it
and
the
father
suggested
that
the
boy
should
now
pull
out
one
nail
for
each
day
that
he
held
his
temper
.
The
days
passed
and
the
young
boy
was
finally
able
to
tell
his
father
that
all
the
nails
were
gone
.
 
The
father
took
his
son
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
fence
.
He
said
,
""
You
have
done
well
,
my
son
,
but
you
look
at
the
fence
.
It
will
never
be
the
same
.
When
you
say
things
in
anger
,
they
leave
a
scar
just
like
this
one
.
You
can
put
a
knife
in
a
man
and
draw
it
out
.
It
wo
n't
matter
how
many
times
you
say
I
'm
sorry
,
the
wound
is
still
there
.
A
verbal
wound
is
as
bad
as
a
physical
one

"All
parents
know
that
one
of
their
most
important
tasks
is
to
prepare
their
children
for
an
independent
life
,
but
any
parent
can
tell
you
that
it
's
hard
to
let
go
of
your
children
.
That
balance
between
keeping
your
children
safe
and
allowing
them
to
learn
from
their
own
mistakes
can
be
heartbreaking
.
Years
of
experience
means
that
parents
often
do
know
best
,
but
on
the
other
hand
,
the
young
,
being
less
bound
by
tradition
,
are
often
more
creative
,
more
able
to
find
new
solutions
to
old
problems
.
Revolutions
are
led
by
the
young
.
 
Good
teachers
make
the
growth
of
critical
thinking
easier
in
their
students
,
only
to
find
that
this
can
lead
to
a
questioning
of
the
teachers
'
basic
beliefs
.
Schools
encourage
parents
to
become
involved
,
but
are
often
embarrassed
when
parents
have
reservations
about
some
of
the
educational
methods
being
used
.
Governments
encourage
unimportant
groups
to
empower
themselves
in
order
to
participate
fully
in
the
development
process
.
And
they
are
often
surprised
when
the
new
leaders
of
these
groups
turn
around
and
attack
the
policies
of
that
same
government
.
The
rebellions
young
and
the
newly
unimportant
groups
are
important
in
social
development
.
They
are
not
necessarily
representatives
of
those
they
want
to
represent
or
not
realistic
in
their
demands
,
but
their
voices
must
be
heard
.
 
Good
parents
know
that
just
forbidding
particular
behaviors
does
not
prevent
their
children
from
finding
ways
to
engage
in
these
forbidden
activities
.
Indeed
,
sometimes
the
forbidden
fruit
is
more
inviting
,
just
because
it
is
not
accepted
by
authority
.
Parents
must
work
with
their
children
to
educate
them
on
the
facts
,
know
as
much
as
possible
about
he
lives
of
their
children
,
provide
a
good
example
,
encourage
more
wholesome
activities
but
also
support
their
children
when
they
do
n't
follow
what
is
expected
of
them
.
But
the
most
important
point
is
that
they
also
need
to
learn
how
to
let
go

"Should
doctors
ever
lie
to
benefit
their
patient
--
-to
speed
recovery
or
to
cover
the
coming
of
death
?
In
medicine
as
in
law
,
government
,
and
other
lines
of
work
,
the
requirements
of
honesty
often
seem
dwarfed
by
greater
needs
:
the
need
to
protect
from
brutal
news
or
to
uphold
a
promise
of
secrecy
;
to
advance
the
public
interest
.
 
What
should
doctors
say
,
for
example
,
to
a
46-year-old
man
coming
in
for
a
routine
physical
check
up
just
before
going
on
vacation
with
his
family
who
,
though
he
feels
in
perfect
health
,
is
found
to
have
a
form
of
cancer
that
will
cause
him
to
die
within
six
months
.
Is
it
best
to
tell
him
the
truth
?
If
he
asks
,
should
the
doctor
reject
that
he
is
ill
,
or
minimize
the
gravity
of
the
illness
?
Should
they
at
least
hide
the
truth
until
after
the
family
vacation
?
 
Doctors
face
such
choices
often
.
At
times
,
they
see
important
reasons
to
lie
for
the
patient
's
own
sake
;
in
their
eyes
,
such
lies
differ
sharply
from
self-serving
ones
.
 
Studies
show
that
most
doctors
sincerely
believe
that
the
seriously
ill
patients
do
not
want
to
know
the
truth
about
their
condition
,
and
that
informing
them
risks
destroying
their
hope
,
so
that
they
may
recover
more
slowly
,
or
deteriorate
faster
,
perhaps
even
commit
suicide
.
 
But
other
studies
show
that
,
contrary
to
the
belief
of
many
physicians
;
a
great
majority
of
patients
do
want
to
be
told
the
truth
,
even
about
serious
illness
,
and
feel
cheated
when
they
learn
that
they
have
been
misled
.
We
are
also
learning
that
truthful
information
,
humanly
conveyed
,
helps
patients
cope
this
illness
:
help
them
tolerate
pain
better
,
need
less
medicine
,
and
even
recover
faster
after
operation
.
 
There
is
urgent
need
to
debate
this
issue
openly
.
Not
only
in
medicine
,
but
in
other
professions
as
well
,
practitioners
may
find
themselves
repeatedly
in
difficulty
where
serious
consequences
seem
avoidable
only
through
deception
.
Yet
the
public
has
every
reason
to
know
professional
deception
,
for
such
practices
are
peculiarly
likely
to
become
deeply
rooted
,
to
spread
,
and
to
trust
.
Neither
in
medicine
,
nor
in
law
,
government
,
or
the
social
sciences
can
there
be
comfort
in
the
old
saying
,
""
What
you
do
n't
know
ca
n't
hurt
you
.

"The
preventive
measures
for
forest
fires
include
some
preemptive
methods
that
can
help
reduce
the
risks
of
fires
and
control
their
severity
and
spread
,
and
thus
,
maintain
ecological
balance
and
protect
resources
.
Close
monitoring
of
forest
fires
caused
by
natural
factors
can
help
prevent
their
spread
to
a
large
extent
.
To
contain
forest
fires
,
fire
departments
usually
use
water
and
chemical
fire
retardants
that
can
be
dropped
from
planes
and
helicopters
.
To
control
the
spread
of
a
wildfire.firefighters
usually
create
a
control
line
by
removing
all
fuel
from
an
area
so
that
the
fire
can
not
travel
across
it
.
 
Controlled
burns
are
often
employed
by
government
authorities
to
reduce
fuel
buildup
,
and
clean
up
the
fallen
leaves
,
and
thus
,
prevent
the
spread
of
forest
fires
to
a
vast
area
.
Regular
controlled
burns
can
also
help
maintain
biodiversity
,
as
the
smoke
and
heat
produced
in
the
process
can
facilitate
the
growth
of
seeds
of
certain
plant
species
.
Apart
from
these
,
responsible
human
behavior
can
help
reduce
the
number
of
forest
fires
to
a
great
extent
.
In
fact
,
we
can
reduce
the
number
of
wildfires
dramatically
by
not
leaving
behind
any
source
of
fire
in
the
forest
.
 
Forest
fires
can
affect
climate
and
weather
to
a
great
extent
,
besides
causing
severe
damage
to
valuable
trees
.
Wildfires
can
increase
the
level
of
greenhouse
gases
(
water
vapor

increase

However
,
they

also
an
important
part

and
many
plants
depend
on
the

generated
by

growth

But
large

cause
extensive

again

the

"When
was
the
last
time
someone
did
something
unexpectedly
nice
for
you
?
Not
someone
you
knew
,
but
a
total
stranger
?
It
's
happened
to
me
a
few
times
,
but
two
instances
really
stand
out
.
 
A
few
years
ago
,
I
was
dining
out
with
a
person
who
kept
going
on
and
on
about
himself
,
completely
unaware
of
the
fact
that
I
was
sitting
there
in
misery
.
It
was
n't
his
company
that
disappointed
me
.
I
was
recovering
from
a
bad
grade
in
my
study
.
I
could
have
collapsed
in
tears
right
there
at
the
table
.
 
When
we
picked
up
the
check
,
the
waitress
said
,
""
Your
meal
was
already
paid
for
.
""
My
friend
and
I
did
n't
have
a
clue
how
it
happened
.
Then
I
remembered
a
man
coming
in
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
.
He
was
dressed
in
mostly
white
,
sat
down
at
the
bar
,
had
a
glass
of
wine
,
stayed
for
maybe
ten
minutes
and
then
left
.
The
waitress
said
,
""
Yes
,
the
gentleman
who
was
in
here
a
while
ago
paid
for
you
.
""
 
Just
last
year
,
I
was
running
a
half-marathon
.
With
just
0.1
miles
to
go
,
I
was
out
of
gas
.
Runners
call
it
""
hitting
the
wall
""
;
I
thought
I
could
n't
move
another
muscle
.
Out
of
nowhere
,
a
teenager
jogged
up
next
to
me
and
said
,
""
What
's
your
name
sweetie
?
Jennifer
?
Okay
,
Jennifer
,
let
's
go
!
Come
on
!
It
's
just
around
the
corner
!
You
can
do
it
!
""
.
And
he
ran
with
me
until
I
picked
up
my
pace
.
I
found
him
at
the
finish
line
to
thank
him
for
the
encouragement
only
to
learn
he
was
n't
even
supposed
to
be
in
the
race
that
day
.
He
was
running
in
place
of
someone
else
.
 
I
still
shake
my
head
when
I
think
of
these
momentary
angels
that
came
to
me
at
my
point
of
need
.
Do
you
have
any
experiences
like
this
?"	"375

"I
work
at
a
university
in
the
USA
.
There
,
my
team
and
I
are
trying
to
learn
more
about
the
American
black
duck
,
a
kind
of
water
bird
.
And
now
we
are
using
an
exciting
piece
of
equipment
called
a
""
night
vision
scope
""
.
By
using
it
,
we
can
see
the
ducks
in
the
dark
.
 
We
're
worried
about
black
ducks
mainly
because
their
numbers
are
falling
hugely
.
And
we
do
n't
know
whether
there
's
enough
food
on
the
east
coast
for
these
birds
.
There
's
lots
of
information
about
their
daytime
activities
,
but
nothing
about
what
they
do
at
night
,
because
we
do
n't
have
the
equipment
.
But
this
new
""
scope
""
will
make
really
clear
pictures
,
even
on
moonless
nights
,
so
we
will
be
able
to
find
out
more
about
the
ducks
.
 
It
is
very
hard
work
.
There
are
four
of
us
,
and
we
each
work
six
hours
every
day
.
We
study
ducks
in
different
places
,
and
I
sometimes
have
to
take
a
boat
to
where
I
need
to
work.the
weather
is
not
helpful
because
most
of
the
time
it
's
wet
.
Oh
,
and
it
's
so
quiet
that
sometimes
I
need
coffee
to
stop
me
from
falling
asleep
.
 
But
I
like
the
work
.
Over
the
summer
,
we
will
spend
hours
in
a
lab
,
where
we
will
look
at
our
results
together
.
It
will
be
hard
to
stay
there
every
day
because
of
the
hot
weather
--
but
it
is
very
important
to
do
this

"Do
you
know
that
girls
are
seven
times
more
likely
than
boys
to
be
unhappy
and
twice
more
likely
to
commit
suicide
and
that
girls
are
three
times
more
likely
than
boys
to
have
a
negative
attitude
?
Twenty
percent
of
the
girls
in
the
US
between
the
ages
of
12
and
17
drink
alcohol
and
smoke
cigarettes
.
 
So
what
is
mental
health
?
Mental
health
is
how
we
think
,
feel
,
and
act
in
order
to
face
life
's
problems
.
 
A
young
girl
's
mental
health
affects
her
daily
life
and
future
.
Like
physical
health
,
mental
health
is
important
at
every
stage
of
life
.
Caring
for
and
protecting
a
young
girl
's
mental
health
is
important
to
ensure
that
she
grows
up
to
become

Many
children
experience
mental
health
problems
that
are
painful
and
can
be
serious
.
Mental
health
problems
affect
at
least
one
in
every
five
young
people
at
any
given
time
.
Unluckily
,
about
two
thirds
of
all
young
people
with
mental
health
problems
are
not
getting
the
help
they
need
.
Mental
health
problems
can
lead
to
school
failure
,
alcohol
or
other
drug
abuse
,
family
violence
,
or
even
suicide
.
 
There
are
many
signs
that
may
point
to
a
possible
mental
health
problem
in
a
child
or
teenager
.
If
you
are
worried
about
a
child
or
have
any
questions
,
look
for
help
at
once
.
Talk
to
your
doctor
,
a
school
teacher
,
or
other
mental
health
experts
who
are
trained

"When
we
see
well
,
we
do
not
think
about
our
eyes
very
often
.
It
is
only
when
we
can
not
see
perfectly
that
we
realize
how
important
our
eyes
are
.
 
People
who
are
near-sighted
can
only
see
things
that
are
very
close
to
their
eyes
.
Everything
else
seems
blurry
(
unclear
)
.
Many
people
who
do
a
lot
of
work
,
such
as
writing
,
reading
and
sewing
become
near
--
sighted
.
 
People
who
are
far-sighted
suffer
from
just
the
opposite
problem
.
They
can
see
things
that
are
far
away
,
but
they
have
difficulty
in
reading
a
book
unless
they
hold
it
at
arm
's
length
.
If
they
want
to
do
much
reading
,
they
must
get
glasses
,
too
.
 
Other
people
do
not
see
clearly
because
their
eyes
are
not
exactly
the
right
shape
.
They
have
what
is
called
astigmatism
.
This
,
too
,
can
be
corrected
by
glasses
.
Some
people
's
eyes
become
cloudy
because
of
cataracts
.
Long
ago
these
people
often
became
blind
.
Now
,
however
,
it
is
possible
to
operate
on
the
cataracts
and
remove
them
.
 
Having
two
good
eyes
is
important
for
judging
distances
.
Each
eye
sees
things
from
a
slightly
different
angle
.
To
prove
this
to
yourself
,
look
at
an
object
out
of
one
eye
;
then
look
at
the
same
object
out
of
your
other
eye
.
You
will
find
the
object
's
relation
to
the
background
and
other
things
around
it
has
changed
.
The
difference
between
these
two
different
eye
views
helps
us
to
judge
how
far
away
an
object
is
.
People
who
have
only
one
eye
can
not
judge
distance
as
people
with
two
eyes

"There
is
lots
of
junk
in
space
.
Some
of
it
is
from
rockets
.
In
1996
,
a
rocket
broke
into
about
300,000
small
pieces
.
So
far
,
scientists
have
found
over
10,000
man-made
pieces
flying
around
in
space
.
Only
6-7
%
of
them
are
satellites
and
space
probes
.
Astronauts
also
lose
small
things
while
working
in
space
.
In
1965
,
during
the
first
American
spacewalk
,
astronaut
Edward
White
lost
a
glove
.
For
a
month
,
the
glove
stayed
in
space
,
travelling
at
a
speed
of
28,000
kilometers
per
hour
.
It
became
the
most
dangerous
piece
of
clothing
for
the
Earth
in
history
it
flew
away
.
Things
move
very
fast
in
space
.
If
they
hit
one
another
,
it
can
be
dangerous
.
A
little
piece
of
paint
from
a
satellite
once
made
a
hole
in
a
spacecraft
window
.
Last
year
two
US
spacecraft
dropped
some
bolts
,
and
scientists
on
the
Earth
worried
a
lot
.
Luckily
the
bolts
floated
away
into
space
.
They
could
n't
hit
the
spacecraft

"Eleven-year-old
Evan
Green
does
n't
want
to
save
just
one
tree-he
wants
to
save
a
whole
rainforest
!
 
In
the
Redwood
City
,
Calif
,
a
boy
started
a
group
called
the
Red
Dragon
Conservation
Team
four
years
ago
to
do
just
that
.
So
far
,
the
team
's
members
have
raised
$
4,500
.
That
's
enough
to
purchase
and
protect
more
than
16
acres
of
rainforest
in
Costa
Rica
through
the
Center
for
Ecosystem
survival
.
 
Every
year
,
thousands
of
square
miles
of
rainforest
are
destroyed
worldwide
.
Logging
and
farming
are
mostly
likely
to
blame
,
scientists
say
.
The
loss
is
terrible
news
for
animals
and
people
.
Even
though
rainforests
cover
less
than
2
percent
of
the
earth
,
they
are
home
to
half
the
world
's
plants
and
animals
.
Rainforests
also
provide
water
and
help
control
the
earth
's
climate
.
 
Evan
's
work
to
save
the
rainforests
recently
earned
him
a
Barron
prize
for
Young
Heroes
.
The
prizes
are
given
to
children
or
teenagers
who
have
made
a
positive
difference
in
the
world
.
Evan
's
goal
is
""
to
save
enough
rainforests
to
last
forever
""
.
He
wo
n't
have
to
do
it
alone
.
His
actions
have
already
inspired
other
kids
to
chip
in
.
One
girl
asked
for
donations
instead
of
presents
on
her
birthday
.
She
raised
$
850
.
Other
kids
are
starting
their
own
conservation
teams
.
 
Evan
says
everyone
can
help
the
planet-even
by
taking
small
steps
such
as
recycling
.
He
and
his
family
try
to
make
a
difference
every
day
.
""
We
recycle
,
we
try
to
limit
our
garbage
...
we
've
been
walking
a
little
more
,
and
we
buy
local
food
,

"There
's
a
guy
like
me
in
every
state
and
federal
prison
in
America
,
I
guess
--
I
'm
the
guy
who
can
get
these
for
you
:
cigarettes
,
a
bag
of
cigar
,
if
you
want
that
,
a
bottle
of
wine
to
celebrate
your
son
or
daughter
's
high
school
graduation
,
or
almost
anything
else
...
within
reason
,
that
is
.
It
was
n't
always
that
way
.
 
I
came
to
Shawshank
when
I
was
just
twenty
,
and
I
am
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
prison
who
is
willing
to
admit
what
he
did
.
I
committed
murder
.
I
put
a
large
insurance
policy
on
my
wife
,
who
was
three
years
older
than
1
was
,
and
then
I
fixed
the
brakes
of
the
car
her
father
had
given
us
as
a
wedding
present
.
It
worked
out
exactly
as
I
had
planned
,
except
I
had
n't
planned
on
her
stopping
to
pick
up
the
neighbour
woman
and
the
woman
's
son
on
the
way
down
Castle
Hill
and
into
town
.
The
brakes
let
go
and
the
car
crashed
through
the
bushes
,
gathering
speed
.
Bystanders
said
it
must
have
been
doing
fifty
or
better
when
it
hit
the
base
of
the
Civil
War
statue
in
the
town
arid
burst
into
flames
.
 
I
also
had
n't
planned
on
getting
caught
,
but
caught
1
was
.
I
got
a
pass
into
this
place
.
My
state
has
no
death
penalty
,
but
I
was
tried
for
all
three
deaths
and
given
three
life
sentences
,
to
run
one
after
the
other
.
That
fixed
up
any
chance
of
parole
I
might
have
,
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
The
judge
called
what
I
had
done'an
extremely
evil
crime
'
,
and
it
was
,
but
it
is
also
in
the
past
now
.
 
Have
I
transformed
myself
,
you
ask
?
I
do
n't
know
what
that
word
means
,
at
least
as
far
as
prisons
and
corrections
go
.
I
think
it
's
a
politician
's
word
.
It
may
have
some
other
meaning
,
and
it
may
be
that
1
will
have
a
chance
to
find
out
,
but
that
is
the
future
...
 
I
was
young
,
good
--
looking
,
and
from
the
poor
side
of
town
.
I
met
a
pretty
,
headstrong
girl
who
lived
in
one
of
the
fine
old
houses
on
Carbine
Street
.
She
got
pregnant
later
.
Her
father
was
agreeable
to
the
marriage
if
1
would
take
a
job
in
the
company
he
owned
and
'work
my
way
up'.I
found
out
that
what
he
really
had
in
mind
was
keeping
me
in
his
house
and
under
his
thumb
,
like
a
disagreeable
pet
that
has
not
quite
been
housebroken
and
which
may
bite
.
Enough
hate
eventually
piled
up
to
cause
me
to
do
what
I
did
.
 
Given
a
second
chance
1
would
not
do
it
again
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
that
means
I
am
transformed

"Many
people
think
sports
are
just
for
winning
and
honor
,
but
there
is
a
lot
more
you
can
gain
from
(
get
out
of
)
them
.
I
have
learned
over
the
past
years
that
sometimes
when
I
lose
,
I
get
a
lot
more
out
of
it
than
winning
.
Also
,
I
find
a
lot
of
times
in
sports
,
people
are
getting
too
caught
up
in
the
game
instead
of
just
having
fun
.
The
real
purpose
of
sports
is
to
have
fun
and
learn
life
lessons
along
the
way
.
 
I
greatly
encourage
you
to
be
a
part
of
the
school
sports
.
Even
if
you
are
not
the
best
,
you
can
still
have
fun
.
Sports
give
people
a
great
and
healthy
way
of
spending
an
afternoon
,
instead
of
lying
around
playing
video
games
or
even
getting
into
bad
things
.
Sports
also
give
us
a
sense
of
achievement
.
There
is
n't
a
better
feeling
than
to
have
done
something
fun
and
productive
for
my
day
.
 
I
think
that
we
all
need
sports
to
give
us
courage
.
If
we
try
hard
in
sports
,
we
usually
do
well
.
If
we
did
the
same
in
study
,
we
would
all
be
champions
.
Another
reason
why
I
encourage
you
to
play
sports
is
that
it
's
just
fun
.
Without
sports
,
our
lives
would
just
be
boring
.
So
as
you
may
be
able
to
tell
,
sports
are
amazing
!
 
Our
coaches
not
only
teach
us
to
play
sports
,
but
show
class
and
good
sportsmanship
while
playing
them
.
It
's
never
fun
when
you
lose
to
have
the
competitor
rub
it
in
your
face
.
That
's
why
our
coaches
teach
us
to
show
class
when
we
lose
;
also
,
when
coaches
get
onto
you
,
do
n't
get
down
.
They
only
want
to
see
you
improve
and
learn
from
what
they
say
.
When
you
do
badly
and
they
do
n't
shout
loudly
is
when
you
should
start
worrying
because
they
are
giving
up
on
you
.
 
Overall
,
sports
are
great
!
They
bring
out
the
best
and
worst
of
a
lot
of
us
.
However
,
we
can
'
t
let
sports
get
too
serious
to
where
it
brings
down
all
the
fun
.
So
to
have
the
most
fun
in
sports
,
you
just
need
try
your
best
and
not
worry
so
much
about
the
winning
or
losing

"The
best
way
to
come
first
is
to
go
last
.
An
analysis
of
almost
50
years
of
competitions
--
including
Eurovision
Song
Contests
and
world
skating
championships
--
has
found
that
contestants
are
more
likely
to
win
if
they
are
among
the
last
to
appear
before
the
judges
.
 
The
study
by
an
American
university
appears
to
provide
scientific
proof
that
the
best
man
,
or
woman
,
does
not
always
win
.
 
It
found
that
,
on
average
,
the
last
competitor
to
appear
in
the
Eurovision
Song
Contest
was
more
than
twice
as
likely
to
win
as
the
one
who
went
on
first
.
 
The
first
rounds
of
figure-skating
championships
,
for
which
the
running
order
is
selected
at
random
,
showed
more
dramatic
results
.
The
final
skater
had
a
14
percent
chance
of
victory
,
making
him
or
her
more
than
four
times
as
likely
to
win
as
the
first
skater
.
 
The
study
showed
a
gradual
worsening
of
chances
for
competitors
who
appeared
earlier
in
the
running
order
.
A
contestant
who
appears
first
in
a
contest
is
two
percent
less
likely
to
win
than
one
who
appears
second
.
A
contestant
who
appears
second
is
two
percent
less
likely
to
win
than
one
who
appears
third
,
and
so
on
.
 
The
findings
are
published
in
the
March
issue
of
Acta
Psychologica
,
a
scientific
journal
.
 
Robert
Hardman
,
a
senior
lecturer
in
psychology
at
London
Metropolitan
University
who
specializes
in
the
science
of
decision-making
,
said
that
the
results
were
interesting
.
He
suggested
that
the
effect
was
caused
by
the
limitations
of
the
human
memory
.
 
""
When
people
make
comparisons
,
they
are
n't
really
able
to
make
a
lot
of
fine-grade
discrimination
.
When
contestants
appear
at
the
beginning
of
a
contest
,
judges
have
little
to
compare
them
to
and
are
perhaps
wary
of
the
scores
they
give
,
""
he
said
.
 
""
Later
on
,
when
judges
are
able
to
compare
the
contestants
to
those
that
have
gone
before
,
they
might
give
more
extreme
marks
because
they
feel
more
confident
about
their
judgments
.

"Jack
Brown
was
very
quiet
as
Dr.
Johnson
examined
him
.
The
doctor
looked
at
the
boy
's
throat
,
took
his
temperature
and
listened
to
his
heart
.
Finally
,
he
asked
Jack
's
mother
a
few
questions
 
""
When
did
Jack
begin
to
feel
ill
?
""
""
This
morning
when
he
got
up
.
He
said
he
felt
too
sick
to
go
to
school
today
.
""
""
What
did
he
eat
for
breakfast
?
""
""
He
got
orange
juice
,
two
pieces
of
bread
,
an
egg
and
a
glass
of
milk
.
""
I
see
,
""
the
doctor
asked
Jack
,
""
How
do
you
feel
now
,
My
boy
?
""
Jack
answered
""
Terrible
,
I
think
I
'm
going
to
die
The
doctor
said
,
""
You
wo
n't
die
.
In
fact
,
you
'll
be
fine
by
dinner
time
.
""
""
Oh
,
doctor
!
Do
you
really
think
so
?
""
Jack
's
mother
looked
very
glad
,
Dr.
Johnson
answered
,
""
Mrs.
Brown
,
you
son
has
a
sickness
that
is
common
to
boys
at
a
time
like
this
.
It
comes
and
goes
quickly
.
 
Mrs.
Brown
said
,
""
But
I
do
n't
understand
.
""
""
Today
,
""
the
doctor
told
her
,
""
the
most
exciting
football
final
of
the
World
Cup
is
on
TV
.
If
Jack
feel
well
enough
to
watch
TV
this
afternoon
,
and
I
think
he
does
.
He
will
be
fine
when
the
final
is
over
.
It
's
the
only
cure
I
know
of
this
sickness
.
Now
,
if
you
'll
excuse
me
,
I
must
go
across
the
street
to
see
the
Fords
boy
,
Steve
.
He
seems
to
have
the
same
thing
as
Jack
has
today

said
,
""
Let
us
try
to
crawl
into
the
house
together
.
""
At
that
time
two
mice
happened
to
crawl
into
the
house
,
too
.
The
woman
saw
the
mice
and
shouted
,
""
In
come
two
,
catch
them
!
""
The
two
thieves
were
terribly
frightened
.
The
man
in
the
house
said
,
""
You
saw
them
come
in
but
where
are
they
?
I
will
catch
them
tonight
.
""
The
two
thieves
started
running
away
at
once
.
 
The
two
thieves
wanted
to
make
it
clear
whether
they
had
been
found
or
not
the
night
before
.
The
next
day
they
acted
as
men
selling
sweet
potatoes
and
came
before
the
house
.
The
man
and
the
woman
were
ploughing
in
their
fields
.
The
rope
broke
and
the
woman
came
home
for
a
rope
.
She
saw
two
men
selling
sweet
potatoes
and
wanted
to
buy
some
.
She
picked
out
two
which
looked
like
mice
.
At
the
time
the
man
could
n't
wait
for
her
any
longer
in
the
fields
and
he
ran
back
from
the
fields
to
hurry
her
up
.
The
woman
showed
the
sweet
potatoes
to
the
man
and
said
,
""
How
they
look
like
the
two
of
last
night
.
""
The
man
said
,
""
I
asked
you
to
fetch
a
rope
,
why
do
n't
you
hurry
for
it
?
""
The
two
thieves
ran
away
very
quickly
without
their
sweet
potatoes

"A
new
study
has
been
carried
to
test
the
role
of
story
telling
in
lowering
blood
pressure
.
Dr.
Thomas
Houston
,
a
professor
of
the
University
of
Massachusetts
Medical
School
,
led
a
group
of
scientists
that
investigated
how
pre-recorded
videos
of
hypertension
patients
'
talking
about
their
medical
histories
helped
another
group
of
patients
with
high
blood
pressure
to
control
their
condition
over
several
months
.
 
Houston
was
surprised
by
their
studies
that
suggested
that
communication
can
be
a
powerful
tool
in
medicine
.
They
showed
that
those
who
had
had
similar
experiences
,
when
talking
to
someone
with
a
similar
background
,
could
help
change
their
behavior
to
become
healthier
.
Hypertension
is
difficult
to
control
,
since
it
is
dependent
on
diet
,
exercise
and
mental
state
.
Medical
treatments
with
drugs
,
and
lifestyle
therapies
have
been
ly
ineffective
because
people
find
it
hard
to
follow
those
medical
requirements
.
 
In
the
test
,
his
team
carefully
chose
their
story-tellers
from
230
members
of
a
patients
'
community
with
whom
they
could
most
easily
relate
.
Next
,
they
divided
their
study
population
into
two
groups
.
One
received
three
interactive
DVDs
containing
the
tellers
'
stories
of
their
experiences
in
living
with
and
treating
their
hypertension
.
The
other
were
given
educational
discs
on
an
unrelated
health
topic
.
The
study
volunteers
reported
that
they
had
listened
to
the
DVDs
,
and
after
three
months
,
those
who
heard
the
stories
of
the
hypertensive
patients
lowered
their
blood
pressure
.
 
While
the
study
did
not
address
how
the
story-telling
influenced
the
patients
'
behavior
,
Houston
suspects
that
watching
patients
of
similar
backgrounds
who
had
a
similar
medical
experience
helped
to
motivate
them
to
seek
medical
help
to
their
hypertension
.
They
found
that
after
six
months
the
difference
in
blood
pressure
between
those
who
watched
the
story-tellers
and
those
who
observed
the
unrelated
videos
remained
,
suggesting
that
the
story-telling
continued
to
have
an
effect

"D
 
The
year
is
2094
.
It
has
been
announced
that
a
comet
is
heading
towards
the
Earth
.
Most
of
it
will
miss
our
planet
,
but
two
pieces
will
probably
hit
the
southern
half
of
the
Earth
.
 
On
17
July
,
a
piece
four
kilometers
wide
enters
the
Earth
's
atmosphere
with
a
massive
explosion
.
About
half
of
the
piece
is
destroyed
,
but
the
remaining
part
hits
the
South
Atlantic
at
200
times
the
speed
of
sound
.
The
sea
boils
and
a
huge
hole
is
made
in
the
sea
bed
.
Huge
waves
are
created
and
spread
outwards
from
the
hole
.
The
wall
of
water
,
a
kilometer
high
,
rushes
towards
southern
Africa
at
800
kilometers
an
hour
.
Cities
on
the
African
coast
are
totally
destroyed
and
millions
of
people
re
drowned
.
 
Before
the
waves
reach
South
America
,
the
second
piece
of
the
comet
lands
in
Argentina
.
Earthquakes
and
volcanoes
are
set
off
in
the
Andes
Mountains
.
The
shock
waves
move
north
into
California
and
all
around
the
Pacific
Ocean
.
The
cities
of
Los
Angeles
,
San
Francisco
and
Tokyo
are
completely
destroyed
by
earthquakes
.
Millions
of
people
in
the
southern
half
of
the
earth
are
already
dead
,
but
the
north
wo
n't
escape
for
long
.
Because
of
the
explosions
,
the
sun
is
hidden
by
clouds
of
dust
,
temperatures
around
the
world
fall
to
almost
zero
.
Crops
are
ruined
.
The
sun
wo
n't
be
seen
again
for
many
years
.
Wars
break
out
as
countries
fight
for
food
.
A
year
later
,
no
more
than
10
million
people
remain
alive
.
 
Could
it
really
happen
?
In
fact
,
it
has
already
happened
more
than
once
in
the
history
of
the
Earth
.
The
dinosaurs
were
on
the
Earth
for
over
160
million
years
.
Then
65
million
years
ago
they
suddenly
disappeared
.
Many
scientists
believe
that
the
Earth
was
hit
by
a
piece
of
object
in
space
.
The
dinosaurs
could
n't
live
through
the
cold
climate
that
followed
and
they
died
out
.
Will
we
meet
the
same
end
?"	"369

"The
worst
days
of
any
summer
are
the
rainy
ones
.
We
spend
all
year
looking
forward
to
nice
weather
and
long
,
hot
days
.
In
winter
,
with
its
cloudy
days
and
bitter
cold
,
we
dream
of
those
days
at
the
beach
,
lying
on
the
sand
and
enjoying
the
bright
and
burning
sun
.
And
then
,
summer
comes
,
and
it
rains
.
 
As
a
child
,
I
would
wake
up
to
rainy
summer
days
and
come
close
to
crying
.
It
was
n't
fair
.
We
suffered
through
months
of
school
and
experienced
bad
weather
for
those
short
ten
weeks
of
freedom
.
 
On
those
rainy
summer
days
,
I
had
nothing
fun
to
do
and
could
only
sit
inside
,
staring
out
at
the
rain
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
.
I
was
an
only
child
,
so
there
was
no
one
else
to
play
with
.
My
father
worked
from
home
,
so
I
was
not
truly
alone
,
but
he
could
not
actively
play
with
me
since
he
was
at
work
.
It
was
those
days
that
I
would
watch
whatever
was
on
television
or
read
any
books
that
I
could
find
lying
around
.
I
'd
pray
each
night
that
the
rain
would
not
be
there
the
next
day
.
 
As
an
adult
,
though
,
my
opinion
of
summer
rain
has
changed
.
When
you
have
to
work
every
day
,
summer
is
not
as
exciting
.
Everything
seems
uninteresting
.
Such
a
mindset
makes
you
cheer
for
anything
new
or
different
.
I
spend
the
winter
dreaming
of
summer
and
the
summer
dreaming
of
winter
.
When
summer
comes
,
I
hate
how
hot
it
is
.
And
then
I
look
forward
to
the
rain
,
because
the
rain
brings
with
it
a
cold
front
,
which
makes
me
comfortable
.
Rainy
days
are
still
the
worst
days
of
the
summer
,
but
summer
rain
today
means
positively
beautiful
--
and
quite
cooler
--
weather
tomorrow

"Have
you
ever
stood
side
by
side
with
an
elephant
and
touched
its
ear
or
its
long
nose
?
A
marvelous
opportunity
is
offered
here
for
you
to
experience
working
with
these
giant
animals
.
The
daily
highlight
is
the
walk
from
the
elephant
orphanage
down
to
the
river
to
bathe
the
elephants
.
Imaging
what
an
amazing
fun
it
is
to
watch
an
entire
herd
splashing
around
and
rolling
in
the
river
just
feet
in
front
of
you
!
 
This
opportunity
is
available
through
a
programme
designed
for
visitors
and
volunteers
to
work
in
the
world-famous
government-run
elephant
orphanage
in
Pinnawela
,
Sri
Lanka
.
The
orphanage
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
largest
centers
of
its
kind
in
the
world
,
with
one
of
the
most
successful
captive
breeding
programmes
for
Asian
elephants
.
 
Pinnawela
Orphanage
is
situated
in
the
hills
of
central
Sri
Lanka
.
It
was
established
in
1975
by
the
Sir
Lanka
Wildlife
Department
.
The
orphanage
's
24
acres
are
a
home
for
the
many
baby
elephants
found
in
the
jungle
without
their
mothers
.
In
most
of
these
cases
the
mothers
had
either
died
or
been
killed
.
Baby
elephants
cared
for
by
the
orphanage
are
released
into
the
wild
when
they
reach
a
certain
age
.
 
The
volunteers
'
working
hours
are
quite
short
so
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
sightsee
and
explore
.
The
volunteer
work
consists
mainly
of
the
day-to-day
aspects
of
running
the
orphanage
,
rather
than
more
specialized
research-based
work
.
 
The
volunteers
'
main
duties
are
cleaning
the
elephant
homes
in
the
morning
(
hard
,
muddy
work
!
)
and
bathing
some
of
the
smaller
elephants
.
Some
elephants
are
overly
large
or
have
not
been
tamed
or
trained
to
a
satisfactory
level
.
However
there
are
still
enough
opportunities
to
have
full
hands-on
contact
safely
.
 
While
the
mahouts
are
bathing
the
larger
elephants
,
you
will
have
a
chance
to
relax
by
the
river
,
chat
with
the
mahouts
and
watch
the
elephants
play
and
interact
with
humans
and
each
other
.
It
is
an
ly
beautiful
sight
.
Being
around
these
serene
animals
in
such
a
beautiful
setting
can
have
a
very
calming
effect
!
 
If
you
are
interested
in
such
an
experience
,
contact
us
for
more
information

At

there
are
over
1,000,000
unemployed
men
in
Britain
.
If
a
woman
gets
a
job
,
she
puts
one
more
man
out
of
work
.
Perhaps
that
man
has
a
wife

twelve

Let

"Supermarket
Morrisons
today
announced
to
launch
an
online
shopping
operation
within
two
years
in
a
move
to
catch
up
with
its
web-savvy
rivals
.
The
UK
's
fourth
biggest
supermarket
said
Morrisons.com
would
offer
grocery
and
non-food
products
but
would
take
time
to
build
from
zero
.
 
As
part
of
its
online
development
,
Morrisons
-
the
only
one
of
the
""
Big
Four
""
grocers
to
have
a
significant
internet
business
-
revealed
it
had
invested
PS32
million
in
a
10
%
stake
of
a
New
York-based
online
grocer
.
The
announcement
came
as
Morrisons
posted
a
13
%
increase
in
underlying
pre-tax
profits
of
PS869
million
in
the
year
to
January
30
.
 
Morrisons
is
implementing
a
growth
strategy
which
is
focused
on
expanding
its
e-commerce
business
and
moving
into
the
convenience
store
market
.
It
has
earmarked
PS3
billion
in
investment
over
the
next
three
years
.
The
supermarket
floated
the
idea
of
launching
its
own
website
last
year
and
today
is
the
first
firm
commitment
to
realising
that
goal
.
 
Last
month
,
the
company
took
its
first
major
step
to
launching
an
online
operation
with
the
acquisition
of
internet
retailer
Kiddicare
for
PS70
million
.
The
company
said
this
move
,
along
with
the
10
%
""
strategic
""
stake
in
American
online
grocer
FreshDirect
announced
today
,
would
help
it
launch
its
own
website
in
the
future
.
FreshDirect
was
launched
in
2002
and
serves
600,000
customers
in
New
York
,
New
Jersey
and
Connecticut
.
The
deal
will
see
Morrisons
chief
executive
Dalton
Philips
join
the
company
's
board
.
 
Morrisons
also
revealed
it
would
open
three
convenience
stores
,
around
3,000
sq
ft
in
size
,
in
July
under
the
name
M
Local
.
The
shops
will
be
located
in
Morrisons
'
heartland
in
the
north
of
England
,
in
neighbourhoods
around
the
M62
motorway
.
The
company
said
the
convenience
business
was
the
second-fastest
growing
part
of
the
market
.
Rival
models
include
Tesco
Metro
and
Sainsburys

"Coffee
grows
only
in
the
tropics
.
The
temperature
must
be
between
65
and
70
degrees
Fahrenheit
.
Coffee
must
have
shade
from
nearby
trees
,
but
it
also
requires
at
least
two
hours
of
sunlight
each
day
.
 
It
was
in
the
18thand
19thcenturies
that
coffee
seeds
from
the
Middle
East
were
taken
to
Latin
America
,
the
Carribean
,
and
Africa
.
It
spread
fast
,
with
demand
for
the
coffee
growing
in
the
northern
part
of
the
world
.
Millions
of
acres
of
rainforest
and
jungle
were
planted
with
coffee
trees
.
Because
of
coffee
's
need
for
shade
and
its
ability
to
be
grown
alongside
other
crops
,
the
small
coffee
trees
did
n't
require
any
forests
to
be
cleared
.
 
But
this
took
a
bad
turn
in
1970
when
US
agricultural
scientists
decided
to
develop
a
new
coffee
plant
that
grew
only
in
the
full
sun
.
Farmer
agreed
to
grow
this
new
coffee
because
they
could
produce
five
times
more
coffee
than
before
.
With
the
support
of
local
governments
,
it
is
n't
difficult
to
understand
why
many
traditional
coffee
fields
quickly
became
modern
ones
.
As
a
result
,
over
the
past
40
years
,
Central
America
has
lost
two-thirds
of
its
rainforests
at
a
rate
of
40
million
acres
per
year
.
That
figure
is
similar
to
Mexico
.
 
These
modern
coffee
plantations
are
very
harmful
as
nothing
can
grow
in
the
fields
besides
the
coffee
bushes
.
As
the
rainforests
disappear
,
so
do
the
animals
.
Sun
plantations
also
contribute
to
soil
erosion
.
The
coffee
trees
must
face
not
only
the
heat
with
no
protection
,
they
must
also
face
heavy
rains
,
which
slowly
washes
much
of
the
soil
away
.
Sun
coffee
field
are
actually
risky
for
farmers
in
the
long
term

"Little
Tommy
was
doing
very
badly
in
math
.
His
parents
had
tried
everything
--
tutors
,
cards
,
special
learning
centers
--
in
short
,
everything
they
could
think
of
.
Finally
they
took
Tommy
to
a
catholic
school
.
 
After
the
first
day
,
little
Tommy
came
home
with
a
very
serious
look
on
his
face
.
He
did
n't
kiss
his
mother
hello
.
Instead
,
he
went
straight
to
his
room
and
started
studying
.
Books
and
papers
were
spread
out
all
over
the
room
and
little
Tommy
was
hard
at
work
.
His
mother
was
surprised
.
She
called
him
down
to
dinner
and
as
soon
as
he
finished
eating
,
he
went
back
to
his
room
,
without
a
word
.
In
no
time
he
was
back
hitting
the
books
as
hard
as
before
.
This
went
on
for
some
time
,
day
after
day
while
the
mother
tried
to
understand
what
was
happening
.
 
Finally
,
little
Tommy
brought
home
his
report
card
.
He
quietly
put
it
on
the
table
and
went
up
to
his
room
and
hit
the
books
.
His
mom
looked
at
it
and
to
her
surprise
,
little
Tommy
got
an
A
in
math
.
She
could
no
longer
hold
her
curiosity
.
She
went
to
his
room
and
asked
,
""
Son
,
what
was
it
?
Was
it
the
nuns
?
""
 
Little
Tommy
looked
at
her
and
shook
his
head
,
""
No.
""
 
""
Well
then
,
""
she
asked
again
.
""
WHAT
was
it
?
""
 
Little
Tommy
looked
at
her
and
said
,
""
Well
,
on
the
first
day
of
school
,
when
I
saw
that
man
nailed
to
the
plus
sign
,
I
knew
they
were
n't
joking
.

"In
Victorian
times
,
certain
flowers
expressed
meanings
because
the
flower
selection
was
limited
.
Therefore
,
flower
as
a
gift
was
an
effective
tool
in
social
communication
.
With
so
many
choices
today
,
we
have
no
rules
in
flower
choosing
.
However
,
people
tend
to
give
a
certain
flower
their
own
personal
meaning
--
-
maybe
it
can
remind
them
of
some
particular
friends
or
events
.
Here
I
would
introduce
the
traditional
meanings
of
some
gift
flowers
as
a
reference
for
your
flower
choosing
.
 
Carnation
is
a
good
gift
for
your
female
teacher
or
mother
,
but
not
all
kinds
of
carnations
men
respect
and
love
.
Different
colours
have
different
meanings
.
Generally
,
carnation
means
""
fascination
and
woman
love
""
.
Specifically
,
pink
carnation
means
""
I
'll
never
forget
you
""
and
red
carnation
says
""
I
admire
you
""
.
But
some
carnations
have
very
negative
meanings
.
If
you
want
to
say
goodbye
to
your
girlfriend
,
you
can
send
her
a
bunch
of
striped
carnations
or
yellow
ones
,
because
it
means
""
Sorry
I
ca
n't
be
with
you
.
You
disappointed
me
.
""
 
Rose
is
no
doubt
the
best
gift
for
girls
in
love
.
Basically
,
it
relates
to
the
love
between
men
and
women
,
but
roses
with
different
colours
stand
for
different
stages
of
love
.
Red
rose
is
man
's
best
friend
when
he
wants
to
show
his
love
to
a
girl
.
In
the
peak
of
his
love
,
pink
rose
is
more
suitable
because
it
means
""
perfect
happiness
and
please
believe
me
""
.
While
the
love
gets
into
trouble
,
yellow
rose
seems
to
be
the
best
symbol
.
It
means
""
the
decrease
of
love
and
jealousy
""
.
 
Though
you
are
free
to
choose
any
kind
of
flower
as
long
as
it
is
beautiful
,
I
think
this
breif
introduction
can
help
you
avoid
making
mistakes
.
Besides
,
the
receivers
must
be
happier
if
he
or
she
gets
to
know
the
good
will
you
convey
in
flowers

"Most
Americans
receive
at
least
two
or
three
credit
card
applications
in
the
mail
every
month
.
Why
have
credit
cards
become
so
popular
?
For
a
merchant
,
the
answer
is
obvious
.
By
putting
charge
slips
in
a
bank
,
the
merchant
can
change
credit
card
sales
into
cash
.
In
return
for
processing
the
merchant
's
credit
card
transactions
,
the
bank
charges
a
fee
that
ranges
between
1.5
and
5
percent
.
 
The
easiest
way
to
establish
credit
is
to
open
checking
and
savings
accounts
at
your
local
bank
.
Then
apply
for
a
gasoline
or
store
credit
card
.
These
cards
are
fairly
easy
to
get
because
retailers
want
you
to
buy
their
goods
and
services
.
The
third
step
,
and
the
most
dangerous
one
,
is
obtaining
a
major
credit
card
like
Visa
,
MasterCard
,
or
American
Express
.
 
It
is
important
to
choose
a
credit
card
carefully
because
terms
and
conditions
vary
widely
.
Annual
fees
range
from
$
15
to
$
75
a
year
,
but
some
credit
card
companies
charge
no
annual
fee
at
all
.
If
you
will
be
one
of
the
growing
number
of
people
who
do
n't
pay
off
their
credit
card
debts
in
full
each
month
,
look
for
the
card
with
the
lowest
interest
rate
.
Interest
rates
generally
range
from
12
to
18
percent
,
though
it
is
possible
to
find
cards
with
lower
rates
.
 
A
credit
card
can
be
your
friend
because
it
can
get
you
through
unexpected
emergencies
.
And
if
there
is
a
problem
with
the
products
or
service
you
purchase
with
your
credit
card
,
you
have
an
opportunity
to
hold
back
payment
by
asking
the
credit
card
company
to
""
charge
back
""
to
the
retailer
until
the
argument
is
settled
.
Monthly
credit
card
statements
can
also
help
you
keep
your
records
in
order
.
Finally
,
if
you
make
payments
on
time
,
the
card
helps
you
to
establish
a
good
credit
history
.
 
A
credit
card
can
be
your
enemy
because
it
is
an
invitation
to
purchase
items
you
really
do
not
need
.
The
credit
card
companies
'
continuous
offers
of
minimum
payments
,
cash
advances
,
and
even
months
without
payments
may
seem
like
a
way
to
skate
through
a
money
crisis
.
In
reality
,
your
finance
charges
and
fees
only
increase
,
and
you
go
deeper
into
debt
.
 
If
you
do
find
yourself
in
trouble
,
do
not
ignore
the
bills
.
Contact
your
creditors
to
explain
your
problem
and
express
your
desire
to
pay
down
your
card
balance
.
If
that
fails
,
a
nonprofit
organization
like
Consumer
Credit
Counseling
Service
can
assist
you
in
getting
back
on
your
financial
feet

to
four
hours
a
day
doing
things
,
such
as
walking
the
city
streets
,
exploring
a
nature
preserve
,
or
taking
a
leisurely
rowboat
ride
.
 
These
kinds
of
activities
are
n't
just
good
for
your
physical
health
.
They
improve
your
mental
health
,
even
your
spiritual
health
.
And
they
make
vacations
memorable
and
worthwhile
.
Here
are
some
fresh
ideas
for
active
and
healthy
vacation
.
 
Make
the
morning
your
activity
time
.
At
that
time
it
is
most
likely
that
the
weather
will
be
friendlier
,
your
energy
level
higher
,
and
your
schedule
emptier
than
later
in
the
day
.
 
Have
a
walk
at
dawn
or
dusk
.
Such
activity
is
called
rejuvenation
.
Try
to
make
this
a
daily
routine
of
life
away
from
home
,
and
you
will
guarantee
yourself
both
physical
and
spiritual
youth
.
 
Get
into
the
water
as
much
as
you
can
.
Do
n't
allow
yourself
to
spend
your
entire
time
sitting
in
front
of
the
water
.
Whether
it
is
the
ocean
,
a
swimming
pool
,
or
a
tree-lined
lake
,
make
sure
you
get
into
the
water
for
swimming
or
games
or
even
walking
.
Merely
standing
in
waist-high
water
is
a
good
workout
,
thanks
to
the
action
of
the
water
.
And
you
'll
feel
so
much
more
alive
!
 
Choose
a
cruise
for
your
trip
.
It
's
amazing
how
active
you
can
be
being
stuck
on
a
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
Atlantic
.
Most
cruise
ships
offer
numerous
options
for
seaworthy
exercise
.
During
your
sea
and
land
trips
you
can
burn
calories
as
you
swim
,
hike
,
dive
,
and
horseback
ride
.
 
Get
out
of
the
car
every
two
hours
.
Many
of
us
spend
a
large
part
of
our
vacations
on
the
road
,
either
getting
to
and
from
our
destinations
,
or
using
the
car
for
sightseeing
.
But
no
matter
how
beautiful
the
scenery
is
,
great
and
memorable
vacations
do
n't
happen
in
a
car
seat
.
Do
n't
wait
for
tiredness
or
nature
's
call
to
get
you
to
pull
over
.
Frequently
get
out
and
stretch
,
walk
,
picnic
,
shop
,
visit
,
and
have
fun
.
It
's
important
for
your
health
and
energy
,
and
it
makes
traveling
a
lot
more
active
and
interesting

"People
have
been
talking
about
health
for
a
long
time
because
people
know
the
importance
of
it
.
People
's
understanding
of
health
also
becomes
deeper
with
the
progress
in
scientific
research
.
Recently
the
term
""
health
""
has
come
to
have
a
wider
meaning
than
it
used
to
.
It
no
longer
means
just
the
absence
of
illness
.
Today
,
health
means
the
well-being
of
your
body
,
your
mind
and
your
relationship
with
other
people
.
This
new
concept
of
health
is
closely
related
to
another
term-quality
of
life
.
Quality
of
life
is
the
degree
of
overall
satisfaction
that
a
person
gets
from
life
.
 
Why
has
the
emphasis
of
health
shifted
from
the
absence
of
disease
to
a
broader
focus
on
the
quality
of
a
person
's
life
?
One
reason
for
this
has
to
do
with
the
length
and
conditions
of
life
that
people
can
now
expect
.
Medical
advances
have
made
it
possible
for
people
today
to
live
longer
,
healthier
lives
.
Imagine
for
a
moment
that
you
were
born
in
the
year
1900
.
You
could
have
expected
on
average
to
live
until
about
the
age
of
47
.
In
contrast
,
if
you
were
born
in
the
year
1999
,
you
could
expect
to
live
to
the
age
of
75

"I
once
thought
that
outer
beauty
is
the
only
factor
to
become
a
great
person
.
When
I
was
young
,
I
read
many
kinds
of
books
,
most
of
which
described
characters
who
are
handsome
or
beautiful
.
So
I
think
that
being
beautiful
is
the
only
way
to
become
a
success
.
 
As
I
grew
up
,
the
story
of
my
best
friend
made
me
realize
that
outer
beauty
was
not
so
important
to
make
a
person
successful
.
She
is
so
beautiful
a
girl
that
every
classmate
liked
to
chat
with
her
,
but
she
was
very
arrogant
.
In
her
opinion
,
she
could
get
all
she
wanted
because
of
her
beauty
,
but
all
of
her
friends
left
her
one
by
one
!
Only
then
did
she
come
to
know
the
importance
of
the
beauty
in
a
person
's
heart
,
which
changed
her
attitude
and
she
made
friends
again
.
 
Turning
on
TV
,
we
can
see
many
advertisements
,
most
of
which
seem
to
give
us
a
feeling
that
,
physical
attractiveness
is
the
most
important
thing
.
T
_
.
It
is
surprising
that
more
and
more
people
,
especially
girls
and
women
,
try
it
like
the
first
man-made
beauty
in
China
,
Hao
Lulu
.
It
is
a
common
sense
that
attractive
people
can
easily
find
work
.
Most
good
looking
guys
,
usually
get
higher
scores
in
the
job
interviews
.
But
,
what
is
real
beauty
?
I
want
to
say
that
is
inner
beauty
because
those
who
have
beauty
in
their
soul
are
really
beautiful
persons
.
 
As
is
known
,
the
beauty
judged
with
eyes
is
temporary
,
so
we
should
concentrate
on
inner
beauty
.
And
if
we
make
the
efforts
to
make
our
minds
beautiful
,
we
'll
live
a
happier
life

"June
5
is
World
Environment
Day
.
This
makes
us
pay
more
attention
to
our
environment
and
the
need
to
protect
it
.
 
When
Wang
Baoxuan
,
a
Beijing
high
school
boy
,
finishes
his
exercise
books
,
he
does
not
throw
them
away
.
He
puts
them
in
the
big
box
in
the
corner
of
his
classroom
.
Other
students
do
so
.
Then
the
exercise
books
are
sold
to
a
paper-factory
in
Beijing
.
The
paper
is
collected
and
used
again
by
students
and
teachers
in
the
school
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
money
made
from
selling
the
paper
goes
towards
schools
in
Inner
Mongolia
for
planting
trees
and
grass
.
During
spring
time
,
the
sandstorms
often
attack
here
.
 
Wang
's
school
is
one
of
the
schools
in
the
capital
that
take
part
in
the
""
green
promise
""
environmental
protection
activity
.
So
far
,
nearly
210,000
students
have
taken
part
in
the
activity
,
collecting
more
than
174
kilograms
of
waste
paper
.
 
""
There
are
some
environment
problems
in
the
city
,
such
as
sandstorms
.
We
should
do
our
duty
and
encourage
others
to
do
so
as
well
.
""
Said
Wang
.
 
Vice-premier
Zeng
Peiyan
has
written
a
letter
to
the
teachers

to
encourage
them
to

"A

bit

The
24-year-old
gorilla
came
out
of
his

quarters
through
an

door
on
Monday
morning
.
He
ran
into

space

was
used

workers

closed
to
the
public

A
keeper
who
has

Koga
since
he
arrived
in

was
bitten
on
her
hand
and
leg

inside
the
habitat
of
a
female
gorilla
and
her
newborn
baby
.
The
keeper
's
decision
to
lock
herself
inside
the
separate
habitat
likely
kept
her
from
being
further
harmed
.
The
keeper
had
a
good
relationship
with
the
mother
who
,
like
Koga
,
is
a
west
lowland
gorilla
,
native
to
West
Africa
and
the
Congo
River
Basin
,
according
to
Fernandes
.
 
Several
locked
doors
prevented
Koga
from
running
wildly
through
the
zoo
and
beyond
.
The
police
sent
in
a
team
to
make
sure
the
area
was
safe
while
a
vet
used
a
pipe
to
sedate
Koga
.
The
gorilla
was
dragged
by
the
zoo
staff
back
to
his
cage
once
the
drugs
took
hold
.
 
Visitors
to
the
zoo
were
moved
indoors
and
stayed
there
for
about
45
minutes
while
the
team
was
trying
to
catch
the
gorilla
and
send
it
back
to
his
cage
.
""
That
was
the
scariest
thing
I
've
ever
done
in
my
career
,
""
said
the
team
's
captain
Mark
Maraschiello
.
""
It
's
a
400-pound
gorilla
.
Nobody
knew
what
harm
he
could
do
to
us
.
He
could
have
bitten
my
arm
off
easily
,

"It
was
1961
and
I
was
in
the
fifth
grade
.
My
marks
in
school
were
miserable
and
,
the
thing
was
,
I
did
n't
know
enough
to
really
care
.
My
older
bother
and
I
lived
with
Mom
in
an
ugly
multi-family
house
in
Detroit
.
We
watched
TV
every
night
.
The
background
noise
of
our
lives
was
gunfire
and
horses
'
hoofs
from
""
Wagon
Train
""
or
""
Cheyenne
""
,
and
laughter
from
""
I
Love
Lucy
""
,
or
""
Mister
Ed
""
.
After
supper
,
we
'd
lie
on
Mom
's
bed
and
stare
for
hours
at
the
TV
screen
.
 
But
one
day
Mom
changed
our
world
forever
.
She
turned
off
the
TV
.
Our
mother
had
only
been
able
to
get
through
third
grade
.
But
,
she
was
much
brighter
and
smarter
than
we
boys
know
at
the
time
.
She
had
noticed
something
in
the
suburban
houses
where
she
cleaned
books
.
So
she
came
home
one
day
,
switched
off
the
TV
,
sat
us
down
and
explained
that
her
sons
were
going
to
make
something
of
themselves
.
""
You
boys
are
going
to
read
two
books
every
week
,
""
she
said
.
""
And
you
're
going
to
write
a
report
on
what
you
read
.
""
 
We
moaned
and
complained
about
how
unfair
it
was
.
Besides
,
we
did
n't
have
any
books
in
the
house
other
than
Mom
's
Bible
.
But
she
explained
that
we
would
go
where
the
books
were
:
""
I
'll
drive
you
to
the
library
.
""
 
So
pretty
soon
there
were
these
two
peevish
boys
sitting
in
her
white
1959
Oldsmobile
on
their
way
to
Detroit
Public
Library
.
I
wandered
reluctantly
among
the
children
's
books
.
I
loved
animals
,
so
when
I
saw
some
books
that
seemed
to
be
about
animals
,
I
started
leafing
through
them
.
 
The
first
book
I
read
clear
through
wasChip
the
Dam
Builder
.
It
was
about
beavers
.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
was
lost
in
another
world
.
No
television
program
had
ever
taken
me
so
far
away
from
my
surroundings
as
did
this
virtue
visit
to
a
cold
stream
in
a
forest
and
these
animals
building
a
home
.
 
It
did
n't
dawn
on
me
at
the
time
,
but
the
experience
was
quite
different
from
watching
TV
.
There
were
images
forming
in
my
mind
instead
of
before
my
eyes
.
And
I
could
return
to
them
again
and
again
with
the
flip
of
a
page
.
 
Soon
I
began
to
look
forward
to
visiting
this
quiet
sanctuary
form
my
other
world
.
I
moved
from
animals
to
plants
,
and
then
to
rocks
.
Between
the
covers
of
all
those
books
were
whole
worlds
,
and
I
was
free
to
go
anywhere
in
them
.
Along
the
way
a
funny
thing
happened
:
I
started
to
know
things
.
Teachers
started
to
notice
it
too
.
I
got
to
the
point
where
I
could
n't
wait
to
get
home
to
my
books
.
 
Now
my
older
brother
is
an
engineer
and
I
am
chief
of
pediatric
neurosurgery
at
John
Hopkins
Children
's
Center
in
Baltimore
.
Sometimes
I
still
ca
n't
believe
my
life
's
journey
,
from
a
failing
and
indifferent
student
in
a
Detroit
public
school
to
this
position
,
which
takes
me
all
over
the
world
to
teach
and
perform
critical
surgery
.
 
But
I
know
when
the
journey
began
the
day
Mom
switched
off
the
TV
set
and
put
us
in
her
Oldsmobile
for
that
drive
to
the
library

was
walking
the
next
.
Citizens
of
New
Castle
simply
refer
to
it
as
""
The
Miracle
""
.
 
Joel
Haler
woke
up
in
his
dorm
room
at
Hope
College
last
October
totally
paralyzed
from
the
waist
down
.
Four
hospitals
later
,
the
only
way
he
could
walk
was
through
Robotic
Walking
Treatment
.
 
""
This
past
Tuesday
,
I
was
doing
the
Robotic
walk
and
lasted
ten
minutes
,
""
Joel
said
.
After
that
,
he
gave
up
.
Joel
wanted
to
accept
the
inevitable
and
cancelled
his
next
Robotic
Walking
Treatment
appointment
.
 
Then
,
the
night
before
his
cancelled
appointment
,
he
woke
up
to
a
terrible
pain
.
An
hour
and
a
half
later
,
the
serious
pain
left
him
with
an
unusual
feeling
in
his
legs
.
 
""
As
it
continued
to
move
up
my
legs
,
it
became
more
and
more
painful
and
it
took
an
hour
and
a
half
to
reach
my
hips
,
""
Joel
recalled
.
 
""
I
stood
up
and
walked
into
my
parents
'
room
.
'Mom
and
dad
,
look
!
'
,
""
he
said
proudly
.
 
""
He
said
something
and
I
was
like
,
'Joel
!
Joel
!
You
're
walking
!
You
're
walking
!
'
We
jumped
out
of
bed
,
cried
and
hugged
,
""
Joel
's
mom
Karen
remembered
.
 
""
I
burst
into
tears
.
It
's
hard
seeing
your
son
not
be
able
to
walk
,
but
he
was
standing
there
,
walking
,
""
Joel
's
father
Eric
said
,
tearfully
.
 
It
was
Thursday
,
January
23
,
when
he
could
finally
walk
.
That
date
made
perfect
sense
to
Joel
.
He
had
dreamt
of
a
calendar
that
only
said
""
J
23
""
.
He
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
until
""
a
little
boy
at
church
,
four
years
old
,
came
up
to
me
and
said
,
'you
will
walk
on
a
Thursday
'
,
""
Joel
recalled
.
 
So
the
20-year-old
college
student
,
who
could
only
walk
with
the
aid
of
robot
on
Tuesday
,
was
walking
on
his
own

"Dreaming
is
a
natural
part
of
who
we
are
.
We
explore
our
dreams
and
develop
personal
dreams
.
We
even
like
to
dream
BIG
!
 
For
the
most
part
our
dreams
and
wishes
focus
on
the
end
result
.
We
see
ourselves
in
love
,
married
,
driving
a
great
car
,
on
vacation
,
with
tons
of
money
,
in
a
great
career
,
etc
.
Dreaming
about
the
end
result
is
just
fantasizing
and
wishing
.
Wishing
relies
on
some
magical
force
to
make
our
dreams
turn
into
reality
,
and
we
become
unhappy
as
we
're
not
living
our
dreams
.
 
So
how
can
we
make
our
dreams
come
true
?
That
is
a
question
we
all
often
struggle
with
.
Even
though
we
struggle
with
the
answer
,
the
answer
is
not
that
clear
.
We
make
our
dreams
come
true
with
the
action
we
take
.
 
In
my
opinion
,
if
you
dream
about
being
in
good
health
,
then
change
your
dream
to
see
yourself
working
out
and
eating
right
day
by
day
.
See
the
beginning
of
the
dream
and
let
the
dream
build
day
by
day
with
all
the
action
that
gets
you
to
the
end
dream
of
you
being
in
good
health
.
 
If
you
want
riches
,
then
change
the
dream
.
Dream
of
yourself
going
to
school
,
developing
a
career
,
working
hard
and
taking
the
steps
to
arrive
at
the
destination
.
If
you
want
love
,
love
the
process
.
Love
the
dating
process
.
Love
yourself
and
the
journey
to
find
love
.
 
Make
all
your
dreams
include
the
beginning
,
middle
and
end
.
Then
when
you
are
doing
the
action
instead
of
thinking
to
yourself
,
""
This
is
a
drag
.
I
do
n't
like
working
out
,
""
or
if
you
are
having
any
negative
thoughts
about
doing
the
work
it
takes
to
create
your
visions
,
realize
then
that
every
step
of
the
way
you
are
living
your
dream
.
You
are
living
your
dream
because
you
made
the
action
and
journey
part
of
your
dream

"Going
on
a
road
trip
?
The
St.
Louis
Arch
,
Statue
of
Liberty
and
Golden
Gate
Bridge
are
great
tourist
sites
.
But
if
you
prefer
offbeat
destinations
,
check
out
the
following
roadside
attractions
.
 
World
's
Largest
Ball
of
Paint
 
Alexandria
,
Ind
.
 
In
1977
,
Michael
Carmichael
set
out
to
create
the
biggest
ball
of
paint
anywhere
.
Starting
with
a
baseball
as
center
,
he
painted
layer
after
layer
of
paint
day
after
day
,
year
after
year
.
The
ball
weighs
more
than
1,300
pounds
,
with
more
than
20,000
coats
of
paint
,
which
is
recognized
by
Guinness
World
Records
.
Visitors
can
paint
the
ball
themselves
and
become
part
of
history
.
 
The
Museum
of
Dirt
 
Boston
,
Mass
.
 
The
museum
is
the
idea
of
Glenn
Johnson
.
Labeled
glass
bottles
contain
such
treasures
as
dirt
from
the
Great
Wall
of
China
,
as
well
as
sand
from
a
desert
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
Omaha
Beach
in
France
.
Best
of
all
,
the
cost
of
seeing
this
museum
is
dirt
cheap
:
It
's
free
.
 
Mount
Horeb
Mustard
Museum
 
Mount
Horeb
,
Wis
.
 
It
's
heaven
for
hotdog
lovers
!
This
museum
claims
to
have
the
world
's
largest
collection
of
prepared
mustard
.
Its
more
than
4
,
100
bottles
of
spices
come
from
60
nations
,
including
Turkey
and
China
.
Visitors
learn
the
history
of
mustard
,
from
how
it
's
made
to
how
it
's
advertised
and
sold
.
The
museum
's
creator
,
Barry
Levenson
,
loves
mustard
so
much
that
he
even
puts
it
on
ice
cream
!
 
Paper
House
 
Rockport
,
Mass
.
 
Swedish
immigrant
Ellis
Stenman
was
much
ahead
of
his
time
in
1922
,
when
he
started
to
build
a
two-room
house
almost
entirely
out
of
newspaper
.
At
the
time
,
people
did
n't
give
much
,
if
any
,
thought
to
recycling
paper
.
In
fact
,
""
recycling
""
was
n't
even
a
word
yet
.
The
house
is
framed
with
wood
,
but
the
walls
are
made
of
215
layers
of
newspaper
.
In
all
,
he
used
about
100,000
newspapers
.

"Do
you
know
of
anyone
who
uses
the
truth
to
deceive
?
When
someone
tells
you
something
that
is
true
,
but
leaves
out
important
information
that
should
be
included
,
he
can
give
you
a
false
picture
.
 
For
example
,
some
might
say
,
""
I
just
won
a
hundred
dollars
on
the
lottery
.
It
was
great
.
Itook
that
dollar
ticket
back
to
the
store
and
turned
it
in
for
one
hundred
dollars
!
""
 
This
guy
is
a
winner
,
right
?
Maybe
,
maybe
not
.
We
then
discover
that
he
bought
$
200
worth
oftickets
,
and
only
one
was
a
winner
.
He
's
really
a
big
loser
!
 
He
did
n't
say
anything
that
was
false
,
but
he
left
out
important
information
on
purpose
.
That
's
called
a
half-truth
.
Half-truths
are
not
technically
lies
,
but
they
are
just
as
dishonest
.
 
Some
politicians
often
use
this
trick
.
Let
's
say
that
during
Governor
Smith
's
last
term
,
her
state
lostone
million
jobs
and
gained
three
million
jobs
.
Then
she
seeks
another
term
.
One
of
her
opponents
says
,
""
During
Governor
Smith
's
term
,
the
state
lost
one
million
jobs
!
""
That
's
true
.
However
,
anhonest
statement
would
have
been
,
""
During
Governor
Smith
's
term
,
the
state
had
a
net
gain
of
two
million
jobs
.
""
 
Advertisers
will
sometimes
use
half-truths
.
It
's
against
the
law
to
make
false
statements
,
so
they
try
to
mislead
you
with
the
truth
.
An
advertisement
might
say
,
""
Nine
out
of
ten
doctors
advised
their
patients
to
take
Yucky
Pills
to
cure
toothache
.
""
It
fails
to
mention
that
they
only
asked
ten
doctors
and
nine
of
them
work
for
the
Yucky
Company
.
 
This
kind
of
deception
happens
too
often
.
It
's
a
sad
fact
of
life
:
Lies
are
lies
,
and
sometimes
the
truthcan
lie
as
well

"You
may
know
the
saying
:
An
apple
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
.
A
recent
study
by
the
Chinese
University
of
Hong
Kong
has
discovered
another
saying
:
An
apple
a
day
keeps
old
age
away
.
 
The
study
involved
fruit
flies
(
g
)
,
as
they
share
many
genes
with
humans
.
Researchers
gave
one
group
of
fruit
flies
normal
food
,
and
another
group
of
fruit
flies
got
the
same
food
including
apple
.
 
The
results
showed
that
flies
that
ate
apple
lived
an
average
of
55
days
longer
than
the
flies
that
did
n't
eat
apple
.
The
study
also
found
that
apple-eating
flies
were
more
able
to
walk
,
climb
and
move
about
as
they
became
old
,
the
Journal
of
Agricultural
and
Food
Chemistry
reports
.
 
The
researchers
believe
that
the
antioxidants
found
in
apples
are
good
for
health
.
 
In
another
experiment
,
researchers
studied
the
diets
of
thousands
of
women
.
They
found
that
those
women
who
often
ate
apples
were
20
percent
less
likely
to
have
heart
disease
.
 
Scientists
have
recently
discovered
the
apple
's
genetic
code
.
This
allows
scientists
to
make
new
kinds
of
fruit
that
are
healthier
.
Researchers
are
already
using
this
information
to
grow
apples
with
added
antioxidants
.
Antioxidants
help
to
keep
eyes
and
joints
healthy
and
protect
against
heart
attacks
and
cancer
.
 
Apples
that
help
people
lose
weight
may
be
in
supermarkets
in
just
four
or
five
years
.
They
are
said
to
be
""
extra
healthy
""
apples
that
can
stop
people
from
overeating

"A
rare
butterfly
has
been
discovered
in
Britain
for
the
first
time
in
60
years
,
having
moved
from
Eastern
Europe
.
The
only
previous
record
of
a
wild
yellow-legged
Tortoiseshell
in
Britain
was
in
1953
,
when
it
was
seen
just
once
in
Sevenoaks
,
Kent
.
Several
weeks
ago
,
there
were
already
four
confirmed
sightings
,
along
the
East
coast
in
Norfolk
,
Suffolk
and
Kent
,
and
six
further
reports
of
the
butterfly
in
coastal
areas
.
Conservationists
are
very
excited
about
the
sightings
,
which
are
rare
in
the
butterfly
world
.
 
The
butterflies
are
thought
to
have
flown
on
easterly
winds
across
Europe
in
the
last
few
weeks
.
The
large
and
colourful
insect
mainly
lives
in
Eastern
Europe
.
In
recent
years
,
it
has
spread
into
Scandinavia
and
its
number
increases
rapidly
during
warm
weather
.
Also
known
as
the
Scarce
Tortoiseshell
,
it
has
an
orange
and
blue
colour
and
is
about
one
third
bigger
than
our
own
Small
Tortoiseshell
.
 
Butterfly
Conservation
was
starting
its
annual
Big
Butterfly
Count
,
a
yearly
survey
of
the
butterflies
across
the
nation
.
Sir
David
Attenborough
,
President
of
the
charity
,
said
,
""
The
UK
is
a
nation
of
amateur
naturalists
and
we
have
a
proud
tradition
of
celebrating
and
studying
our
wildlife
.
By
taking
part
in
the
Big
Butterfly
Count
this
summer
,
you
can
contribute
to
discovering
the
fantastic
butterflies
and
other
wildlife
that
share
your
garden
,
parks
and
countryside
.
""
He
added
,
""
Butterflies
fought
back
last
year
after
a
terrible
2012
but
despite
this
,
butterfly
numbers
were
still
below
average
.
Three
quarters
of
the
UK
's
butterflies
are
in
decline
and
one
third
are
in
danger
of
dying
out
.
This
is
bad
news
for
the
UK
's
birds
,
bees
,
bats
and
other
wildlife

"Child
labor
--
the
employment
of
children
in
industry
,
often
against
their
will
--
has
been
a
problem
for
many
years
.
Over
a
hundred
years
ago
,
Charles
Dickens
shocked
many
of
his
readers
when
he
described
the
conditions
under
which
young
children
worked
in
British
factories
.
The
conditions
Dickens
described
continue
almost
unchanged
today
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.
The
only
difference
is
that
today
employment
of
children
is
confined
(
limited
)
to
small
industries
and
family
businesses
,
such
as
hotels
,
restaurants
and
particularly
farms
,
rather
than
to
large
factories
.
 
Girls
suffer
more
from
child
labor
practices
than
boys
.
Many
of
them
are
forced
to
start
work
when
they
are
only
ten
years
old
.
Although
the
work
they
are
given
to
do
is
often
light
,
it
is
often
harmful
to
the
health
.
Recently
,
children
as
young
as
six
years
were
found
to
be
working
in
Asian
factories
,
and
the
children
were
working
from
eight
to
fourteen
hours
a
day
in
overcrowded
and
unhealthy
working
conditions
.
Sometimes
a
whole
family
group
is
employed
,
with
the
payment
going
to
a
parent
or
older
relative
.
The
children
not
only
receive
nothing
or
very
little
for
their
long
hours
of
work
,
but
also
they
are
prevented
from
attending
school
.
Therefore
,
when
they
become
older
they
are
unable
to
do
any
other
kind
of
work
.
 
The
solution
to
the
problem
of
child
labor
is
clearly
better
laws
to
protect
young
children
,
greater
supervision
of
industry
and
heavier
fines
for
those
who
break
the
laws
.
Only
in
this
way
can
young
boys
and
girls
be
allowed
to
enjoy
the
most
valuable
time
of
their
lives
--
childhood

"Daniel
Brown
was
just
five
years
old
when
he
climbed
into
the
family
car
and
let
it
roll
away
down
the
road
.
He
was
only
three
when
he
flooded
the
kitchen
.
 
His
mother
,
Angela
Brown
is
very
busy
looking
after
her
new
baby
,
a
little
girl
called
Laura
,
as
well
as
Daniel
.
She
told
us
,
""
Daniel
is
so
full
of
curiosity
.
""
At
that
moment
,
we
hear
a
loud
noise
and
then
silence
.
We
go
upstairs
and
find
Daniel
getting
out
of
a
wardrobe
which
he
has
pulled
over
onto
the
floor
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand
.
""
It
's
for
you
,
Mum
,
""
he
says
and
looks
up
at
his
mum
and
smiles
.
Seven-year-old
Daniel
has
a
lovely
face
.
He
has
golden
hair
,
big
brown
eyes
,
and
a
friendly
smile
.
I
have
to
admit
that
Daniel
does
n't
look
like
a
naughty
boy

Angela
told
me
all
about
it

I
found
him
as
he
was
about
to
put
Jasper
in
the
washing
machine
.
""
Jasper
,
she
explained
,
is
the
Browns
'
dog
.
""
When
I
asked
him
why
,
he
said
that
he
thought
Jasper
was
dirty
!
It
's
amazing
how
one
little
boy
can
cause
so
much
trouble
.
Another
time
he
cut
off
all
the
hair
of
the
little
girl
next
door
.
She
was
going
to
attend
her
sister
's
wedding
and
the
neighbors
have
n't
spoken
to
us
since
.
""
 
Angela
told
me
about
Daniel
's
most
expensive
crime
.
""
I
was
about
to
do
the
washing
up
when
the
baby
started
crying
.
Daniel
decided
to
help
and
filled
the
kitchen
sink
with
water
.
When
I
came
in
,
the
water
was
already
flooding
the
kitchen
and
was
about
to
flood
the
hall
.
The
carpet
was
ruined
and
had
to
be
replaced
.
I
hope
things
will
get
better
as
he
gets
older
.
""
 
Amazingly
,
Daniel
is
quite
well
behaved
in
school
.
This
may
be
because
he
is
seldom
bored
.
Meanwhile
he
continues
to
be
the
naughtiest
little
boy
in
England
.
Will
his
baby
sister
Laura
grow
up
to
be
the
naughtiest
little
girl
?"	"1

"The
first
time
I
went
abroad
was
when
I
went
to
London
.
It
was
in
the
summer
holidays
about
five
or
six
years
ago
and
I
went
with
three
friends
.
The
plane
and
train
were
quite
expensive
,
so
we
decided
to
travel
by
coach
.
We
left
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
the
journey
to
London
took
about
sixteen
hours
but
we
did
n't
mind
:
we
were
all
very
excited
because
for
all
four
of
us
it
was
our
first
time
away
from
home
.
 
We
stayed
in
London
for
three
days
,
in
a
youth
hotel
not
far
from
the
centre
.
While
we
were
there
,
we
walked
a
lot
.
First
,
we
went
to
see
all
the
famous
sites
--
Big
Ben
,
Piccadilly
Circus
,
Buckingham
Palace
,
then
we
went
shopping
in
Oxford
Street
.
On
the
last
morning
my
friends
stayed
in
bed
late
,
but
I
got
up
early
and
went
to
Camden
Market
.
You
can
buy
all
kinds
of
jewelry
and
clothes
there
,
and
I
bought
a
silver
ring
for
my
sister
.
It
was
really
hot
in
the
afternoon
,
so
we
went
to
Hyde
Park
for
a
game
of
football
.
Unfortunately
,
I
think
the
ring
fell
out
of
my
pocket
during
the
game
,
because
I
could
n't
find
it
when
I
got
on
the
coach
that
evening
!
 
I
've
been
back
to
London
several
times
since
then
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
ever
feel
as
excited
as
I
did
that
first
time

"When
in
doubt
,
cut
that
out
!
Yeah
,
yea
,
Doubting
Thomas
may
have
had
a
point
in
his
day
,
and
life
may
not
be
what
you
want
it
to
be
,
but
if
you
constantly
doubt
yourself
,
how
can
you
accomplish
anything
?
 
Where
is
your
confidence
?
What
possible
good
can
come
from
taking
the
negative
aspect
of
any
situation
and
growing
it
into
acceptance
?
 
Purpose
of
achievement
is
to
attain
a
goal
.
So
,
if
you
set
your
goals
and
strive
to
get
there
,
it
should
be
assumed
that
you
are
moving
toward
your
goal
no
matter
what
you
are
doing
,
right
?
 
When
watching
a
football
game
,
one
of
those
great
high
school
starter
games
,
set
to
determine
who
starts
when
the
real
games
begin
,
I
noticed
the
coach
called
""
defense
""
only
when
the
team
was
""
protecting
""
their
goal
.
As
long
as
the
team
was
fighting
for
more
ground
they
played
""
offense
""
.
Along
the
same
lines
,
I
've
heard
the
phrase
,
""
a
strong
defense
requires
a
good
offense
.
""
Simply
put
,
if
you
concentrate
more
on
gaining
ground
than
on
protecting
your
goals
,
your
accomplishments
will
be
greater
.
Time
spent
protecting
your
goals
is
wasted
time
,
when
you
could
be
working
toward
attaining
your
goals
rather
than
preventing
others
from
reaching
their
goal
.
 
In
business
,
if
you
waste
your
time
focusing
on
what
your
competitor
is
doing
rather
than
working
toward
meeting
your
goals
,
you
wo
n't
get
very
far
.
 
Focus
your
attention
on
where
you
're
going
.
Do
n't
waste
time
worrying
about
where
your
competition
is
.
You
will
gain
ground
while
they
are
watching
you
.
Smile
as
you
reach
your
destination

"It
is
the
goal
of
politicians
everywhere
--
--
-how
to
win
and
keep
the
trust
of
voters
.
 
Now
researchers
at
the
University
of
St
Anurew
's
in
Scotland
say
they
may
have
the
answer
.
They
believe
politicians
could
learn
a
lot
from
recent
advances
in
science
.
A
growing
number
of
studies
have
shown
that
people
do
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
.
Researchers
say
most
of
us
make
quick
judgments
about
a
person
on
the
basis
of
how
they
look
.
 
Studies
suggest
that
people
are
less
likely
to
trust
those
with
particularly
masculine
features
,
such
as
a
square
jaw
,
small
eyes
or
a
big
nose
.
""
They
are
considered
dominant
and
less
trustworthy
,
""
says
Ms
Cornwell
.
""
It
does
n't
mean
that
men
who
look
more
masculine
are
less
trustworthy
--
--
-it
's
just
our
first
impression
.
""
Those
with
less
masculine
features
--
--
-larger
eyes
,
a
smaller
nose
and
thinner
lips
are
thought
to
be
more
trustworthy
.
 
The
researchers
are
putting
their
science
to
the
test
at
the
Royal
Society
's
annual
summer
exhibition
in
London
.
They
have
copied
the
faces
of
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
,
Conservative
leader
Michael
Howard
and
Liberal
Democrat
leader
Charles
Kennedy
stressing
their
dominant
and
trustworthy
features
.
""
We
have
used
a
computer
program
to
change
the
shape
of
their
faces
and
features
.
We
hope
it
will
help
people
to
understand
our
work
.
""
 
So
should
we
expect
to
see
them
at
the
exhibition
getting
tips
?
 
""
I
do
n't
think
it
's
something
they
will
want
to
try
,
""
says
Ms
Cornwell
.
""
It
's
not
really
possible
with
television
.
We
all
know
what
they
look
like
.

"The
building
is
shaking
.
A
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
is
trying
to
open
the
door
,
but
fails
.
Finding
no
way
,
she
rushes
into
her
bedroom
and
there
they
survive
the
earthquake
.
 
In
a
factory
building
,
as
the
workshop
floor
swings
under
the
terrible
shaking
,
workers
run
for
safety
.
Some
hide
under
the
machines
and
survive
,
but
others
who
try
to
run
outside
are
killed
by
the
falling
ceilings
.
 
These
scenes
,
played
by
actors
and
actresses
,
are
from
a
film
of
science
education
Making
a
Split
Second
Decision
shown
in
1998
on
China
Central
TV
in
memory
of
Tangshan
Earthquake
.
 
By
studying
actual
cases
in
the
earthquake
areas
and
scientific
experiments
,
experts
find
that
buildings
remain
untouched
for
the
first
12
seconds
of
an
earthquake
.
 
In
this
short
time
,
one
has
the
best
chance
of
surviving
an
earthquake
by
staying
near
the
inside
walls
,
in
bedrooms
and
under
beds
,
experts
concluded
in
the
film
.
""
Earthquakes
seem
to
catch
the
lives
of
those
who
run
,
""
said
many
survivors
in
the
earthquake
areas
,
describing
how
their
friends
were
killed
on
the
doorways
or
along
the
stair
steps
as
they
tried
to
get
out
of
the
building
.
 
Their
advice
was
proved
in
the
film
,
""
Take
a
hiding-place
where
you
are
rather
than
run
,
unless
you
are
sure
you
can
reach
a
safe
open
place
in
ten
seconds
.

"Thomas
Brodie-Sangster
's
cars
and
action
figures
were
n't
just
toys
.
""
They
would
always
be
characters
,
and
I
would
always
put
on
stupid
voices
,
""
says
Thomas
(
Born
on
16
May
1990
)
.
For
him
,
acting
was
just
a
matter
of
moving
childhood
games
to
a
set
.
 
Maturity
and
independence
came
to
Thomas
early
as
he
started
work
at
ten
.
After
his
first
audition
,
he
learned
about
rejection
.
Though
hurt
and
disappointed
,
he
took
a
part
in
a
tiny
,
unknown
TV
film
in
2001
.
No
one
noticed
his
performance
-
no
one
except
screenwriter
Richard
Curtis
.
Two
years
later
,
he
played
Sam
,
a
twelve-year-old
in
love
in
Curtis
's
Love
Actually
.
After
that
hit
film
,
he
played
actor
Colin
Firth
's
son
in
Nanny
McPhee
.
Firth
then
joined
a
film
called
The
Last
Legion
and
supported
Thomas
for
its
lead
role
.
As
a
result
,
the
boy
played
Rome
's
final
ruler
in
the
action-adventure
.
 
At
about
16
,
Thomas
had
to
make
a
decision
.
Did
he
really
want
to
devote
his
life
to
acting
?
Many
people
in
the
public
""
are
n't
letting
you
be
you
because
they
see
you
as
something
special
""
,
he
says
.
Also
,
friendship
made
during
filming
was
often
broken
soon
after
the
project
finished
.
Despite
these
things
,
he
found
enough
joy
and
satisfaction
in
the
work
to
continue
.
Actually
,
Thomas
seems
to
find
joy
in
difficulty
itself
.
He
played
10-year-old
Adolf
Hitler
in
a
TV
movie
and
a
teenage
Paul
McCartney
in
Nowhere
Boy
.
The
subject
of
his
film
Death
of
a
Superhero
made
it
his
most
challenging
film
.
Still
,
he
found
a
positive
message
in
its
story
of
a
schoolboy
with
cancer
.
 
Thomas
now
enjoys
roles
in
Game
of
Thrones
and
the
upcoming
Maze
Runner
films
.
Popular
as
those
projects
may
be
,
most
still
recognize
him
as
Sam
in
Love
Actually
.
Sam
seems
to
run
after
Thomas
,
just
as
he
ran
through
Heathrow
airport
to
his
sweetheart

"When
he
was
small
,
Hill
was
a
famous
bad
boy
.
 
At
the
age
of
9
,
his
father
married
his
stepmother
.
At
that
time
they
lived
poor
in
the
countryside
while
his
stepmother
was
from
a
wealthy
family
.
 
His
father
introduced
Hill
to
his
stepmother
as
he
said
,
""
Dear
,
I
hope
you
notice
in
the
entire
shire
this
is
the
worst
boy
,
who
has
made
me
have
no
other
way
.
Maybe
before
tomorrow
morning
he
will
throw
a
stone
at
you
,
or
do
a
bad
thing
you
will
never
ima
gine
.
""
 
To
Hill
's
surprise
,
his
stepmother
went
up
to
him
with
a
smile
,
held
up
his
head
and
looked
at
him
carefully
.
She
then
turned
around
to
tell
her
husband
,
""
You
're
wrong
.
He
is
not
the
worst
boy
in
the
entire
shire
,
but
the
cleverest
and
creative
boy
.
Only
he
does
n't
find
a
place
to
show
himself
.
""
 
His
stepmother
's
words
warmed
his
heart
,
his
eyes
full
of
tears
.
With
this
,
he
started
building
friendship
with
his
stepmother
.
And
this
became
the
drive
of
his
life
,
making
him
create
28
successful
golden
rules
,
which
helped
tens
of
thousands
of
ordinary
people
walk
on
the
road
to
success
.
 
Before
his
stepmother
came
,
no
one
praised
him
smart
,
and
his
father
and
neighbors
considered
him
as
a
bad
boy
.
However
,
his
stepmother
's
words
changed
his
life
.
 
When
Hill
was
14
years
old
,
his
stepmother
bought
him
a
used
typewriter
and
said
to
him
,
""
I
believe
you
will
become
a
writer
.
""
Hill
accepted
his
stepmother
's
gift
and
expectation
,
and
started
writing
things
to
a
local
newspaper
.
He
understood
his
stepmother
's
strong
feeling
of
interest
in
his

"Jones
worked
so
hard
that
made
the
sparks
fly
from
his
hammer
.
The
son
of
Mr.
Smith
,
a
rich
neighbor
,
used
to
come
to
see
the
blacksmith
and
he
would
enjoy
himself
watching
how
the
tradesman
worked
.
""
Why
do
n't
you
try
your
hand
to
learn
to
make
shoe
tacks
?
""
said
the
blacksmith
.
""
Who
knows
,
one
day
,
it
may
be
of
use
to
you
.
""
The
lazy
boy
began
to
see
what
he
could
do
.
But
after
a
little
practice
he
found
that
he
was
becoming
very
skilled
and
soon
he
was
making
some
of
the
finest
tacks
.
 
Old
Mr.
Smith
died
and
the
son
on
account
of
the
war
lost
all
his
goods
.
He
had
to
leave
home
and
was
forced
to
take
up
residence
in
another
country
.
It
so
happened
that
in
this
village
there
were
numerous
shoemakers
who
were
spending
a
lot
of
money
to
buy
tacks
for
their
shoes
and
even
at
times
when
they
paid
high
prices
they
were
not
always
able
to
get
what
they
wanted
,
because
in
that
part
of
the
country
there
was
a
high
demand
for
soldiers
'
shoes
.
 
Young
Smith
,
who
was
finding
it
difficult
to
earn
his
daily
bread
,
remembered
that
he
had
learned
the
art
of
making
tacks
and
had
the
sudden
idea
of
making
a
bargain
with
the
shoemakers
.
He
told
them
that
he
would
make
the
tacks
if
they
would
help
to
get
him
settled
in
his
workshop
.
The
shoemakers
were
only
too
glad
of
the
offer
.
""
How
funny
it
seems
,
""
he
used
to
say
,
""
even
making
tacks
can
bring
a
fortune
.
My
trade
is
more
useful
to
me
than
were
all
my
former
riches
.

"Since
the
beginning
of
time
,
man
has
been
interested
in
the
moon
.
The
Romans
designed
a
special
day
to
show
admiration
and
respect
to
the
moon
.
They
called
it
""
Monday
""
,
or
""
Monday
""
,
as
we
know
it
today
.
Later
,
the
great
mind
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci
studied
the
moon
and
designed
a
machine
to
carry
a
human
to
the
moon
.
Leonardo
said
that
one
day
a
great
machine
bird
would
take
a
person
to
the
moon
and
bring
great
honour
to
the
home
where
it
was
born
.
 
Four
and
a
half
centuries
later
,
Leonardo
's
idea
was
realized
.
Apollo
II
took
three
Americans
Collins
,
Aldrin
,
and
Armstrong
to
the
moon
.
The
mission
did
fill
the
whole
world
with
great
surprise
,
as
Leonardo
had
said
it
would
.
Numerous
(
many
)
essays
,
articles
,
and
books
were
written
about
man
's
first
moon
mission
.
But
perhaps
the
most
interesting
story
was
one
written
before
the
event
over
100
years
before
.
 
In
1865
,
French
author
Jules
Verne
wrote
a
story
about
the
first
journey
to
the
moon
.
His
story
was
very
similar
to
the
1969
Apollo
II
mission
.
 
Verne
's
spacecraft
also
contained
three
men
--
two
Americans
and
a
Frenchman
.
The
spacecraft
was
described
as
being
almost
the
same
size
as
Apollo
II
.
The
launch
site
in
Verne
's
story
was
also
in
Florida
.
The
spacecraft
in
Verne
's
story
was
named
the
""
Columbiad
""
.
The
Apollo
II
command
ship
was
called
""
Columbia
""
.
His
account
description
of
sending
the
spacecraft
into
the
space
could
easily
have
been
written
about
how
Apollo
II
was
sent
into
the
space
.
 
Verne
's
story
was
the
same
as
the
actual
event
in
several
other
respects
.
The
speed
of
Verne
's
spacecraft
was
36,000
feet
per
second
;
Apollo
's
was
35,533
feet
per
second
.
Verne
's
spacecraft
took
97
hours
to
reach
the
moon
;
Apollo
's
time
was
103
hours
.
Like
Apollo
's
spacemen
,
Verne
's
spacemen
took
pictures
of
the
moon
's
surface
,
relaxed
on
their
seats
,
cooked
with
gas
,
and
experienced
weightlessness
.
They
two
came
down
in
the
Pacific
and
were
picked
up
by
an
American
warship
.
 
What
were
the
reasons
for
Jules
Verne
's
extreme
accuracy
in
describing
an
event
100
years
or
more
before
it
actually
occurred
?
He
based
his
writings
on
the
laws
of
physics
and
astronomy
.
Nineteenth-century
science
and
the
vivid
(
clear
)
Verne
's
imagination
gave
people
an
unbelievably
accurate
(
exact
)
prediction
of
one
of
the
greatest
events
of
the
20th
century

Tips
:
 
1/2
cup
of
milk
will
make
about
one
spoon
of
ice
cream
,
so
double
the
recipe
if
you
want
more
.
But
do
n't
increase
the
amount
more
than
that
--
a
large
amount
might
be
too
big
for
kids
to
pick
up
because
the
ice
itself
is
heavy
.
 
Here
is
another
version
of
the
homemade
ice
cream
recipe
from
another
parent
!
 
These
are
the
homemade
ice
cream
ingredients
:
 
1/4
teaspoon
of
vanilla
butter
and
nuts
;
1
tablespoon
of
sugar
;
1/2
cup
of
milk
.
 
These
are
the
other
supplies
:
 
Plastic
sandwich
bag
;
12
salt
pellets
;
1
dish
of
ice
;
large
plastic
bag
.
 
Put
the
ice
cream
ingredients
in
the
small
bag
,
and
then
put
the
bag
,
salt
and
ice
in
the
big
bag
.
Hold
the
bag
shut
and
move
it
around
on
the
floor
for
about
5
minutes
.
 
When
I
made
ice
cream
at
home
last
time
,
although
the
salt
pellets
did
n't
really
dissolve
that
well
,
I
still
got
ice
cream
.
It
was
not
smooth
ice
cream
,
probably
because
of
the
low-fat
milk
.
It
was
incredible
that
it
could
be
ready
in
5
minutes
(
not
counting
preparing
the
ingredients
)
 
Next
,
I
changed
the
recipe
,
using
a
tablespoon
of
cocoa
,
a
tablespoon
of
sugar
,
and
a
cup
of
milk
.
It
was
a
bit
too
chocolaty
,
but
good

"I
have
only
once
been
in
trouble
with
the
law
.
The
whole
process
of
being
arrested
and
taken
to
court
was
a
rather
unpleasant
experience
at
the
time
,
but
it
makes
a
good
story
now
.
What
makes
it
rather
disturbing
was
the
arbitrary
circumstances
both
of
my
arrest
and
my
subsequent
fate
in
court
.
 
It
happened
in
February
about
twelve
years
ago
.
I
had
left
school
a
couple
of
months
before
that
and
was
not
due
to
go
to
university
until
the
following
October
.
I
was
still
living
at
home
at
the
time
.
 
One
morning
I
was
in
Richmond
,
a
suburb
of
London
near
where
I
lived
.
I
was
looking
for
a
temporary
job
so
that
I
could
save
up
some
money
to
go
traveling
.
As
it
was
a
fine
day
and
I
was
in
no
hurry
,
I
was
taking
my
time
,
looking
in
shop
windows
,
strolling
in
the
park
,
and
sometimes
just
stopping
and
looking
around
me
.
It
must
have
been
this
obvious
aimlessness
that
led
to
my
downfall
.
 
It
was
about
half
past
eleven
when
it
happened
.
I
was
just
walking
out
of
the
local
library
,
having
unsuccessfully
sought
employment
there
,
when
I
saw
a
man
walking
across
the
road
with
the
obvious
intention
of
talking
to
me
.
I
thought
he
was
going
to
ask
me
the
time
.
Instead
,
he
said
he
was
a
police
officer
and
he
was
arresting
me
.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
some
kind
of
joke
 
But
then
another
policeman
appeared
,
this
time
in
uniform
,
and
I
was
left
in
no
doubt
.
 
'But
what
for
?
""
I
asked
 
'Wandering
with
intent
to
commit
an
arrestable
offence
,
'
he
said
.
 
'What
offence
?
'
I
asked
 
'Theft
,
'
he
said
 
'Theft
of
what
?
'I
asked
 
'Milk
bottles
,
'
he
said
,
and
with
a
perfectly
straight
face
too
!
 
'Oh
,
'
I
said
.
 
It
turned
out
there
had
been
a
lot
of
petty
thefts
in
the
area
,
particularly
that
of
stealing
milk
bottles
from
doorsteps
.
 
Then
I
made
my
big
mistake
.
At
the
time
I
was
nineteen
,
had
long
untidy
hair
,
and
regarded
myself
as
pan
of
the
sixties
'
'youth
counterculture'.As
a
result
,
I
wanted
to
appear
cool
and
unconcerned
with
the
incident
,
so
I
said
,
'How
long
have
you
been
following
me
?
in
the
most
casual
and
conversational
tone
I
could
manage
.
I
thus
appeared
to
them
to
be
quite
familiar
with
this
sort
of
situation
,
and
it
confirmed
them
in
their
belief
that
I
was
a
thoroughly
disreputable
character
.
 
A
few
minutes
later
a
police
car
arrived
.
 
'Get
in
the
back
,
'
they
said
.
'Put
your
hands
on
the
back
of
the
front
seat
and
do
n't
move
them
.
'
 
They
got
in
on
either
side
of
me
.
It
was
n't
funny
any
more
.
 
At
the
police
station
they
questioned
me
for
several
hours
.
I
continued
to
try
to
look
worldly
and
familiar
with
the
situation
.
When
they
asked
me
what
I
had
been
doing
,
I
told
them
I
'd
been
looking
for
a
job
.
'Aha
,
'
I
could
see
them
thinking
,
'unemployed
'
.
 
Eventually
,
I
was
officially
charged
and
told
to
report
to
Richmond
Magistrates
'
Court
the
following
Monday
.
Then
they
let
me
go
.
 
I
wanted
to
conduct
my
own
defense
in
court
,
but
as
soon
as
my
father
found
out
what
had
happened
,
he
hired
a
very
good
solicitor
.
We
went
along
that
Monday
armed
with
all
kinds
of
witnesses
,
including
my
English
teacher
from
school
as
a
character
witness
.
But
he
was
never
called
on
to
give
evidence
.
My
'trial
'
did
n't
get
that
far
.
The
magistrate
dismissed
the
case
after
fifteen
minutes.1
was
free
.
The
poor
police
had
never
stood
a
chance
.
The
solicitor
even
succeeded
in
getting
costs
awarded
against
the
police
.
 
And
so
I
do
not
have
a
criminal
record
.
But
what
was
most
shocking
at
the
time
was
the
things
my
release
from
the
charge
so
clearly
depended
on
.
I
had
the
'right
'
accent
,
respectable
middle-class
parents
in
court
,
reliable
witnesses
,
and
I
could
obviously
afford
a
very
good
solicitor
.
Given
the
obscure
nature
of
the
charge
.
I
feel
sure
that
if
I
had
come
from
a
different
background
,
and
had
really
been
unemployed
,
there
is
every
chance
that
I
would
have
been
found
guilty
.
While
asking
for
costs
to
be
awarded
,
my
solicitor
's
case
quite
obviously
revolved
around
the
fact
that
I
had
a
'brilliant
academic
record
'
.
 
Meanwhile
,
just
outside
the
courtroom
,
one
of
the
policemen
who
had
arrested
me
was
gloomily
complaining
to
my
mother
that
another
youngster
had
been
turned
against
the
police
.
'You
could
have
been
a
bit
more
helpful
when
we
arrested
you
,
'
he
said
to
me
reproachfully
.
 
What
did
he
mean
?
Probably
that
I
should
have
looked
outraged
and
said
something
like
,
'Look
here
,
do
you
know
who
you
're
talking
to
?
I
am
a
highly
successful
student
with
a
brilliant
academic
record
.
How
dare
you
arrest
me
!

Then
they
,
probably
,
would
have
apologized
perhaps
even
taken
off
their
caps
,
and
let
me
on
my
way

"My
name
is
woof
.
You
think
that
we
have
a
great
life
,
right
?
Wrong
!
I
am
going
to
tell
you
why
.
 
First
of
all
,
we
are
bored
.
Bored
.
bored
.
And
bored
.
Do
you
ever
think
about
what
a
dog
does
all
day
?
Nothing
.
Nothing
at
all
.
Our
owners
are
busy
,
you
know
,
working
,
going
to
school
,
away
from
home
all
day
.
So
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
?
Watch
the
house
or
apartment
?
Sure
.
That
is
like
watching
paint
dry
or
grass
grow
.
Boring
.
That
's
why
we
get
so
excited
when
our
owners
come
home
.
We
bark
and
run
around
and
act
as
if
we
are
very
happy
.
But
we
only
do
this
because
we
are
bored
all
day
.
If
we
are
lucky
,
our
owner
take
us
for
a
walk
.
 
Then
there
is
the
food
.
We
eat
the
same
food
,
meal
after
meal
,
day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
month
after
month
.
Help
!
Would
you
like
to
eat
the
same
thing
all
the
time
?
No
,
you
would
not
.
So
what
makes
you
think
we
dogs
like
it
?
We
do
n't
.
We
hate
it
.
 
Another
thing-television
.
Another
thing-television
.
Dogs
hate
television
.
Our
owners
watch
these
stupid
programs
,
hour
after
hour
,
night
after
night
.
Are
there
any
programs
for
dogs
on
television
?
No
.
Not
a
single
one
.
 
So
what
can
we
do
?
What
else
can
we
do
but
sleep
?
And
so
we
sleep
.
We
dogs
are
not
lazy
,
we
are
bored

"Here
is
some
must-know
information
from
a
handbook
on
how
people
behave
in
doing
business
in
some
countries
.
 
In
Brazil
 
Brazilians
are
warm
and
friendly
.
They
often
stand
close
when
talking
and
it
is
common
for
them
to
touch
the
person
on
the
shoulder
.
People
often
greet
each
other
(
particularly
women
)
with
light
cheek
kisses
.
Schedules
tend
to
be
flexible
,
with
business
meetings
sometimes
starting
later
than
planned
.
But
to
be
safe
,
be
on
time
.
Meals
can
stretch
for
hours
--
there
's
no
such
thing
as
rushing
a
meal
in
Brazil
.
Lunches
also
can
start
in
the
mid
to
late
afternoon
.
Brazilians
are
social
,
preferring
face-to-face
communication
over
emails
or
phone
calls
.
 
In
Singapore
 
Singaporeans
shake
hands
when
they
meet
and
often
also
greet
each
other
with
a
small
,
polite
bow
.
Business
cards
should
be
offered
and
received
with
two
hands
.
Arriving
late
is
considered
disrespectful
.
So
be
on
time
.
Efficiency
is
the
goal
,
so
meetings
and
dealings
often
are
fast-paced
.
Singaporeans
are
direct
in
their
discussions
,
even
when
the
subject
is
about
money
.
Rank
is
important
and
authority
is
respected
.
This
determines
how
people
interact
in
meetings
.
For
example
,
people
avoid
disagreeing
outright
with
someone
of
a
higher
rank
.
 
In
the
United
Arab
Emirates
 
In
the
UAE
,
status
is
important
,
so
the
most
senior
or
oldest
should
be
greeted
first
with
their
titles
.
The
handshake
seems
to
be
longer
than
elsewhere
.
So
do
not
pull
away
from
the
handshake
.
Women
should
cover
themselves
when
it
comes
to
dress
.
Men
also
tend
to
be
covered
from
neck
to
elbows
and
down
to
the
knees
.
People
do
not
avoid
entertaining
in
their
homes
,
but
they
also
hold
business
meals
at
restaurants
.
Touching
or
passing
food
or
eating
with
your
left
hand
is
to
be
avoided
.
When
meetings
are
one-to-one
,
if
your
host
offers
you
coffee
,
you
should
refuse
.
It
might
seem
odd
,
but
it
is
a
cultural
tradition
.
Coffee
should
only
be
accepted
if
it
is
already
set
out
or
presented
.
 
In
Switzerland
 
The
Swiss
tend
to
be
formal
and
address
each
other
by
last
name
.
They
also
are
respectful
of
private
lives
.
You
should
be
careful
not
to
ask
about
personal
topics
.
Punctuality
is
vital
,
something
that
comes
from
a
deep
respect
for
others
'
time
.
Arrive
at
any
meeting
or
event
a
few
minutes
early
to
be
safe
.
They
also
have
clear
structure
in
their
companies
.
Higher-ups
make
the
final
decisions
,
even
if
others
might
disagree
.
Neat
,
clean
dress
is
expected
.
The
Swiss
follow
formal
table
manners
.
They
also
keep
their
hands
visible
at
the
table
and
their
elbows
off
the
table
.
It
is
polite
to
finish
the
food
on
your
plate

"If
you
have
to
miss
a
meal
a
day
,
which
meal
will
cause
you
fewest
health
problems
if
you
do
n't
eat
it
?
If
you
have
to
make
a
decision
of
this
type
,
most
people
(
especially
very
busy
people
)
will
choose
to
skip
breakfast
.
 
However
,
many
experts
in
the
field
of
health
consider
breakfast
(
the
meal
which
""
break
""
you
""
fast
""
)
to
be
the
most
important
t
meal
of
the
day
.
If
we
eat
a
good
breakfast
,
they
say
,
we
will
have
the
energy
and
nutrients
we
need
to
begin
our
working
day
with
vigor
and
stay
hopeful
with
good
honor
.
However
,
many
people
skip
breakfast
or
substitute
a
cup
of
coffee
for
a
well
balanced
meal
.
What
happens
if
we
ignore
the
importance
of
breakfast
?
 
One
recent
study
conducted
in
the
United
States
tested
a
large
number
of
people
.
Participants
included
both
males
and
females
who
ranged
in
age
from
12
to
83
.
The
results
showed
that
if
a
person
eats
an
adequate
breakfast
,
he
or
she
will
work
more
efficiently
and
more
productively
than
if
he
or
she
skips
breakfast
or
eats
a
very
poor
breakfast
.
This
fact
appears
to
be
especially
true
if
a
person
's
work
involves
mental
activities
.
The
study
showed
that
if
school-children
eat
fruit
,
eggs
,
bread
and
milk
before
going
to
school
,
they
will
learn
more
quickly
and
will
be
able
to
concentrate
on
their
lessons
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
if
their
breakfast
is
inadequate
.
 
The
study
also
showed
that
contrary
to
what
people
believe
,
if
you
skip
breakfast
,
you
will
not
lose
weight
.
This
is
because
people
become
so
hungry
if
they
skip
breakfast
that
they
eat
too
much
for
lunch
and
end
up
gaining
weight
instead
of
losing
.
So
remember
,
if
you
want
to
lose
weight
,
skipping
breakfast
will
not
help
you
.
You
will
likely
lose
more
weight
if
you
decrease
your
other
meals

we
decided
to
try
making
a
few
tables
and
chairs
.
John
got
married
six
months
ago
,
and
like
many
young
people
these
days
,
they
are
struggling
to
make
a
home
when
the
cost
of
living
is
very
high
.
The
Koses
took
a
2-week
course
for
$
280
at
a
night
school
.
Now
they
build
all
their
furniture
and
make
repairs
around
the
house
.
 
Jim
Hatfield
has
three
boys
and
his
wife
died
.
He
has
a
full-time
job
at
home
as
well
as
in
a
shoe-making
factory
.
Last
month
,
he
received
a
car
repair
bill
for
$
420
.
""
I
was
very
upset
about
it
.
Now
I
've
finished
a
car
repair
course
.
I
should
be
able
to
fix
the
car
myself
.
""
 
John
and
Jim
are
not
unusual
people
.
Most
families
in
the
country
are
doing
everything
they
can
save
money
so
they
can
fight
the
high
cost
of
living
.
If
you
want
to
become
a
""
do-it-yourself
""
,
you
can
go
to
DIY
classes
.
And
for
those
who
do
n't
have
time
to
take
a
course
,
there
are
books
that
tell
you
how
to
do
things
yourself

"America
's
child
movie
star
Shirley
Temple
Black
died
late
Monday
evening
at
the
age
of
85
.
Her
fans
in
China
are
also
deeply
saddened
.
Temple
is
just
one
example
of
movie
stars
that
China
adored
,
and
still
adores
.
Here
's
our
editor
's
pick
of
the
top
movie
stars
who
have
influenced
China
.
 
1
.
Sylvester
Stallone
 
Oh
,
Rambo
!
The
first
strong
American
man
that
China
knew
.
His
accented
English
,
easily
recognizable
even
for
someone
who
does
n't
speak
English
,
and
his
eyes
that
never
seemed
to
smile
,
makes
him
someone
whom
can
not
be
forgotten
.
He
represented
the
strong
American
image
,
and
even
stirred
a
boxing
and
bodybuilding
fever
in
China
.
 
2.Charlie
Chaplin
(
April
16
,
1889
-
December
25
,
1977
)
 
In
the
20th
century
,
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
Einstein
made
the
greatest
contributions
to
science
,
and
not
many
would
disagree
that
Chaplin
did
the
same
for
film
.
He
was
the
first
actor
that
introduced
comedy
to
most
Chinese
viewers
,
and
politically
,
he
was
also
a
close
friend
of
China
's
.
His
silent
films
broke
the
barrier
of
language
and
his
form
of
art
was
recognized
by
all
.
It
will
be
a
difficult
task
to
find
a
person
in
China
who
does
not
recognize
Chaplin
,
even
today
.
 
3
.
Shirley
Temple
(
April
23
,
1928
-
February
10
,
2014
)
 
When
Chinese
audiences
saw
this
adorable
child
star
for
the
first
time
on
screen
,
Shirley
Temple
had
already
lived
for
more
than
half
a
century
.
In
her
movies
,
she
was
always
alone
or
in
trouble
,
but
this
adorable
little
blonde
could
always
resolve
anything
with
her
kindness
,
push
away
the
fogginess
and
bring
about
light
.
The
brand
""
Shirley
Temple
""
was
a
product
of
the
Great
Depression
.
People
watched
her
act
to
forget
their
hardships
as
Temple
entertained
the
poor
,
the
rich
,
adults
and
children
alike
.
Several
decades
later
,
when
her
films
were
screened
in
China
,
the
effects
were
the
same
.
 
4
.
Audrey
Hepburn
(
May
4
,
1929
-
January
20
,
1993
)
 
She
will
forever
be
the
princess
in
Chinese
people
's
hearts
.
Even
to
this
day
,
a
large
number
of
tourists
go
to
Rome
to
visit
the
Mouth
of
Truth
with
their
lovers
and
eat
ice
cream
on
the
Spanish
Steps
.
Her
sense
of
style
seems
to
never
go
out
of
style
.
When
she
was
alive
,
she
was
living
perfection
.
Even
after
her
death
,
she
has
remained
an
icon
.
That
's
something
that
only
Audrey
Hepburn
is
capable
of
."	"1

"The
Leaning
Tower
of
Pisa
was
straight
like
a
pole
when
the
construction
began
in
1173
.
It
started
to
shift
direction
soon
after
construction
because
of
poor
foundation
in
addition
to
the
loose
layer
of
subsoil
.
At
the
beginning
,
it
leaned
to
the
southeast
before
the
shaky
foundation
started
to
shift
leaning
towards
the
southwest
.
After
the
period
of
structural
strengthening
at
the
beginning
of
the
21stcentury
,
now
the
Leaning
Tower
of
Pisa
leans
at
an
angle
of
3.97
degrees
.
 
In
1178
,
the
shift
in
direction
was
observed
for
the
first
time
when
the
construction
had
progressed
further
to
the
third
floor
.
The
tower
was
heavy
for
the
three-meter
foundation
that
was
built
on
a
weak
area
of
land
.
 
For
compensating
the
leaning
position
,
the
builders
started
to
construct
the
upper
floors
with
one
side
higher
than
the
other
one
.
This
caused
the
tower
to
lean
in
the
other
direction
.
This
unusual
structure
led
to
the
tower
being
actually
curved
.
In
spite
of
these
efforts
,
the
tower
kept
on
leaning
.
 
The
government
of
Italy
started
to
plan
prevention
of
the
complete
collapse
of
the
tower
in
1964
.
However
,
a
request
was
put
forward
by
the
authorities
to
keep
the
leaning
position
because
of
the
tourism
industry
of
the
region
.
 
After
nearly
two
decades
of
careful
planning
by
engineers
,
historians
and
mathematicians
,
the
stabilization
efforts
for
the
Leaning
Tower
of
Pisa
started
in
1990
.
The
tower
was
closed
for
the
general
public
and
the
people
living
nearby
moved
away
.
For
reducing
the
total
weight
of
the
tower
,
its
seven
bells
which
represented
the
seven
musical
notes
were
removed
.
The
tower
was
reopened
for
the
general
public
on
December
15
,
2001
.
 
In
May
2008
,
after
removing
another
70
metric
tons
of
earth
,
the
engineers
announced
that
the
tower
had
been
finally
stabilized
and
it
would
remain
stable
for
at
least
200
years

"Stephen
Hawkins
was
born
in
Oxford
,
England
on
8thJanuary
,
1942
.
He
went
to
school
in
St.
Albans
--
a
small
city
near
London
.
Although
he
did
well
,
he
was
never
top
of
his
class
.
After
leaving
school
,
Hawking
went
first
to
Oxford
University
where
he
studied
physics
,
then
he
went
to
Cambridge
University
where
he
studied
cosmology
.
As
he
himself
admits
,
he
did
n't
work
hard
.
He
was
a
very
lazy
student
,
and
did
very
little
work
.
However
,
he
still
got
good
marks
.
 
It
was
at
the
age
of
20
that
Hawking
first
noticed
something
was
wrong
with
him
.
He
started
to
bump
into
things
.
When
he
visited
his
family
at
Christmas
time
,
his
mother
was
so
worried
that
she
made
him
see
a
doctor
.
Hawking
was
sent
to
hospital
for
tests
.
Finally
,
the
result
came
back
.
Doctors
said
they
had
no
way
to
help
him
.
He
would
die
before
he
was
23
.
 
At
first
,
Hawking
became
very
sad
,
after
a
while
,
though
,
he
began
to
see
his
life
in
a
different
way
.
As
he
later
wrote
,
""
Before
my
illness
was
diagnosed
,
I
had
been
very
bored
with
life
.
There
had
not
seemed
to
be
anything
worth
doing
.
But
shortly
after
I
came
out
of
hospital
,
I
suddenly
realized
that
there
were
a
lot
of
worthwhile
things
I
could
do
.
""
Hawking
married
,
found
a
job
at
Cambridge
University
,
and
had
three
children
.
He
also
went
on
to
do
some
of
the
most
important
scientific
research
.
 
Today
,
Hawking
still
works
at
Cambridge
University
as
a
professor
.
He
strongly
believes
that
his
story
shows
that
nobody
,
however
bad
their
situation
is
,
should
lose
hope
.
""
Life
is
not
fair
,
""
he
once
said
.
""
You
just
have
to
do
the
best
you
can
in
your
own
situation
.

"If

go
to
her

If

This

be

dance
with

it
may
be
that
she

Sometimes

your

"Some
diaries
from
Jackie
Chan
's
blog
 
January
4
,
2009
 
Lately
I
've
been
busy
in
Beijing
having
meetings
to
discuss
my
new
movie
.
I
also
attended
John
Wu
's
ceremony
of
his
new
movie
,
Red
Cliff
,
which
took
two
years
to
complete
.
I
'm
good
friends
with
the
director
John
Wu
and
the
main
actor
Tony
Leung
.
 
January
5
,
2009
 
Today
I
went
to
record
a
television
program
for
Beijing
TV
calledVolunteers
Across
China
.
This
TV
program
is
a
large-scale
reality
show
that
is
based
on
the
idea
that
""
good
people
reap
good
rewards
""
and
it
hopes
to
encourage
people
to
be
more
aware
and
help
the
""
good
people
""
who
are
in
difficult
situations
.
 
January
6
,
2009
 
I
'm
very
pleased
to
announce
that
my
Jackie
Chan
automobile
website
is
set
up
and
officially
operating
!
I
hope
that
through
this
automotive
website
,
I
can
get
in
touch
with
more
people
who
want
to
buy
cars
.
 
January
7
,
2009
 
Today
,
I
went
to
record
a
song
calledZhongguo
Nian
.
This
song
was
written
by
Chang
Shilei
.
I
sing
this
song
together
with
Tan
Jing
.
Chang
Shilei
is
a
naturally
talented
musician
.
He
also
has
an
interesting
habit
.
His
piano
is
placed
next
to
his
bed
.
When
he
wakes
up
,
he
plays
the
piano
until
he
's
tired
,
and
then
he
lies
down
on
his
bed
to
sleep
.
 
January
9
,
2009
 
Today
I
met
with
the
producer
and
director
ofLongwei
Xiaozi
,
and
I
also
brought
along
my
friend
's
daughter
for
a
screen
test
.
Although
my
friend
's
daughter
grew
up
in
China
,
her
English
is
very
good
and
it
just
happened
by
chance
that
this
movie
needs
a
young
actress
for
a
part
,
so
I
took
her
along
to
audition

"Water
is
the
most
common
substance
found
on
the
earth
,
but
less
than
1
%
of
the
earth
's
water
is
suitable
for
drinking
.
More
than
1,000,000,000
people
around
the
world
survive
on
just
over
1
galon
of
water
a
day
.
Probebly
more
than
3,000,000,000
people
may
suffer
from
not
having
enough
water
by
the
year
2025
.
You
are
considered
lucky
if
you
live
in
a
country
where
you
can
drink
water
out
of
your
kitchen
tap
or
bathroom
tap
.
People
in
some
countries
have
to
pay
for
drinking
water
at
home
.
So
clean
water
is
one
of
our
most
valuabe
natural
resources
.
 
In
fact
,
peole
waste
so
much
clean
water
today
.
In
factories
lots
of
water
is
wasted
.
At
home
many
people
are
not
taking
showers
but
still
baths
,
and
many
are
brushing
their
teeth
with
the
tap
turned
on
.
Children
are
no
longer
taught
how
to
save

.
 
You
can
save
clean
water
in
many
ways
.
For
example
,
if
you
keep
gold
fish
,
the
tank
water
excellent
for
graden
plants
.
And
when
you
wash
a
milk
bottle
,
pour
the
water
on
your
house
plants
.
Putting
a
brick
or
a
water
into
your
toilet
tank
many
help
use
less
water
,
saving
many
gallons
over
a
long
time
.
 
Using
rainwater
is
another
simple
way
to
save
clean
water
.
You
can
use
rainwater
to
wash
your
hands
after
gardening
,
flush
the
toilet
,
and
wash
your
car
,
your
pet
,
your
driveway
when
they
are
dirty
.
 
For
the
same
reason
,
people
in
Malaysia
are
encourageed
to
use
rainwater
.
If
one
has
a
house
with
a
small
garden
,
he
would
buy
a
huge
plastic
tank
to
keep
rainwater
for
their
daily
life

"Getting
electricity
has
always
been
a
problem
for
the
173
people
living
in
Nuevo
Saposoa
,
a
small
village
in
Peru
,
South
America
.
However
,
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
in
March
2015
after
heavy
rains
damaged
the
only
power
cables
in
the
area
.
The
villagers
were
forced
to
use
oil
lamps
,
which
are
not
only
expensive
but
also
dangerous
because
of
the
harmful
gases
they
produce
.
 
Luckily
,
researchers
at
the
University
of
Technology
(
UT
)
in
Lima
,
Peru
heard
about
their
problem
and
found
a
wonderful
solution
.
They
made
a
lamp
that
can
be
powered
by
plants
and
soil
,
both
of
which
can
be
easily
found
in
the
Amazonian
rainforest
where
the
village
lies
.
The
lamp
takes
energy
from
a
plant
growing
in
a
wooden
box
and
uses
it
to
light
up
an
LED
light
bulb
.
 
While
that
may
sound
amazing
and
even
impossible
,
the
science
behind
the
ides
is
quite
simple
.
As
plants
create
their
food
(
using
the
sun
's
energy
,
water
and
chemicals
from
the
soil
)
,
they
also
produce
waste
which
they
return
to
the
soil
.
Tiny
animals
in
the
soil
eat
this
waste
and
they
produce
electrons
-
the
building
blocks
of
electrical
energy
.
The
UT
team
put
special
sticks
inside
the
soil
to
capture
the
energy
and
keep
it
in
the
lamp
's
batteries
for
later
use
.
The
researchers
say
a
single
charge
can
power
a
50-watt
Led
light
for
two
hours
-
enough
time
for
local
villagers
to
get
their
evening
work
done
.
 
The
university
gave
ten
Plant
Lamps
to
the
villagers
of
Nuevo
Saposoa
in
October
2015
.
So
far
,
they
have
been
a
huge
success
!
Elmer
Ramirez
,
the
UT
professor
who
invented
the
lamp
,
believes
the
Plant
Lamp
could
help
improve
the
lives
of
many
people
,
especially
small
rainforest
communities
,
42
%
of
whom
have
no
electricity

"Children
today
would
rather
read
,
do
housework
or
even
do
homework
than
play
outside
--
-
and
they
get
out
half
as
much
as
their
parents
did
when
they
were
young
.
 
According
to
a
UK
study
,
those
growing
up
during
the
1970s
and
1980s
enjoying
more
than
two
hours
of
outdoor
activities
each
weekday
,
and
nine
hours
on
weekends
--
whatever
the
weather
is
.
But
their
children
play
outside
for
just
over
one
hour
each
weekday
,
and
fewer
than
five
hours
on
Saturdays
and
Sundays
.
 
So
,
the
UK
started
an
activity
to
encourage
children
to
give
up
30
minutes
of
screen
time
a
day
to
play
outdoors
.
 
The
Wild
Network
,
born
on
September
25
,
2013
,
is
joined
by
more
than
300
organizations
,
large
or
small
.
It
tries
to
attract
children
away
from
television
and
computer
screen
and
into
woods
and
parks
.
 
It
is
the
biggest
ever
activity
to
reconnect
children
with
nature
and
outdoor
activities
,
and
it
plans
to
help
improve
children
's
health
.
 
Suggestions
on
how
to
get
more
time
in
nature
including
collecting
fruits
,
camping
,
watching
autumn
colour
on
trees
and
so
on
.
 
This
is
not
the
first
time
the
message
of
less
screen
,
more
play
has
been
brought
up
.
Children
in
the
1980s
were
encouraged
to
do
the
same
by
BBC
TV
show
Why
Do
n't
You
,
which
encouraged
children
to
""
turn
off
your
TV
set
,
and
go
to
do
something
less
boring
instead
""

"Now
a
lot
of
families
keep
pets
in
their
houses
.
Most
pets
are
small
animals
,
such
as
cats
,
dogs
,
fish
,
snakes
,
birds
and
so
on
.
 
Dogs
are
the
favorite
pets
.
The
second
favorites
are
cats
and
the
third
favorites
are
birds
.
These
small
animals
are
very
cute
and
friendly
.
People
usually
have
them
as
their
family
members
.
They
look
after
them
very
well
,
they
let
them
wear
beautiful
clothes
and
their
pets
have
nice
names
.
They
also
afford
their
pets
nice
food
to
have
.
They
buy
food
for
their
pets
in
pet
shops
.
They
keep
them
clean
every
day
.
 
Pets
are
all
very
happy
.
Many
pets
have
their
houses
and
beds
.
They
often
go
out
to
relax
and
take
a
walk
with
people
in
the
park
in
the
morning
.
 
Some
children
like
pets
because
they
need
a
friend
to
play
with
at
home
.
Many
old
people
do
n't
live
with
their
children
,
and
they
keep
pets
at
home
just
because
they
often
feel
lonely
.
They
have
them
as
their
children
and
they
love
them
very
much
.
So
pets
are
very
important
.
I
think
every
family
needs
pets
.

"Television
in
the
United
States
is
free
.
To
pay
for
programs
,
there
are
many
advertisements
.
Often
these
advertisements
are
short
plays
with
actors
.
The
following
television
advertisement
is
like
many
others
that
Americans
see
daily
.
 
We
see
a
man
and
his
wife
at
the
breakfast
table
.
They
have
been
married
for
a
long
time
.
They
are
not
speaking
to
each
other
.
They
have
n't
spoken
to
each
other
at
the
breakfast
table
for
years
.
The
husband
is
reading
his
newspaper
.
We
ca
n't
see
his
face
.
The
wife
looks
very
bored
as
she
pours
a
cup
of
coffee
for
him
.
Today
,
she
is
using
a
new
kind
of
coffee
for
the
first
time
.
The
husband
picks
up
his
cup
.
He
is
n't
very
interested
.
He
tastes
his
coffee
.
Suddenly
he
puts
down
his
newspaper
.
Something
is
different
.
!
Can
it
be
the
coffee
?
He
takes
another
taste
.
It
's
wonderful
!
He
smiles
.
He
looks
at
his
wife
and
says
in
amazement
,
 
""
Doris
,
when
did
you
cut
your
hair
?
""
 
Doris
is
pleased
.
She
answers
,
""
Two
months
ago
.
""
 
Doris
asks
,
""
Herbie
,
when
did
your
hair
begin
to
turn
gray
?
""
 
He
replies
,
""
A
long
time
ago
.
""
 
Doris
says
,
""
Oh
,
very
handsome
.
""
 
Now
they
are
n't
bored
any
more
.
Breakfast
is
different

Has

of
coffee
changed

"I
think
that
a
great
friend
is
a
great
artist
who
can
change
my
feeling
about
life
greatly
.
When
I
talk
about
the
person
who
influenced
me
most
.
I
must
think
of
my
best
friend
quickly
.
 
When
I
was
in
my
university
,
one
of
my
classmates
sat
beside
me
.
His
name
is
Wang
Tao
.
He
is
my
unforgettable
friend
in
my
life
.
He
is
good
at
study
and
handsome
.
Everyone
knows
that
he
is
a
genius
of
my
university
.
 
He
is
kind
hearted
and
is
always
ready
to
help
others
.
But
he
does
n't
like
others
to
praise
him
,
because
he
think
what
he
did
is
common
.
There
is
an
old
saying
:
A
friend
in
need
is
a
friend
indeed
.
Wang
Tao
sets
a
good
example
in
many
parts
in
my
life
.
 
I
remembered
that
my
mathematics
was
mediocre
at
that
time
,
but
he
was
excellent
in
solving
mathematics
questions
.
He
often
received
high
scores
.
Of
course
,
I
wished
I
could
reach
at
his
level
.
Since
we
talked
all
day
long
,
he
was
patient
and
polite
to
answer
my
mathematics
questions
.
Slowly
,
I
made
great
progress
in
mathematics
.
I
passed
the
examination
finally
.
Then
we
became
friends
naturally
.
And
now
,
I
still
remember
his
strong
will
to
study
.
 
We
know
that
we
live
in
a
society
,
so
we
need
a
lot
of
friends
.
There
are
two
kinds
of
friends
,
good
and
bad
,
bad
friend
may
make
our
life
failed
,
while
good
ones
make
our
life
successful
.
To
me
,
Wang
Tao
is
a
very
good
friend
.
I
learned
so
many
advantages
from
him
,
and
I
changed
more
and
more
excellently
.
 
We
separated
three
months
ago
.
Now
I
miss
him
very
much
,
and
I
hoped
that
our
friendship
will
continue
to
be
just
as
strong
after
we
graduate

"Silence
is
unnatural
to
man
.
He
begins
life
with
a
cry
and
ends
it
in
stillness
.
In
between
he
does
all
he
can
to
make
a
noise
in
the
world
,
and
he
fears
silence
more
than
anything
else
.
Even
his
conversation
is
an
attempt
to
prevent
a
fearful
silence
.
If
he
is
introduced
to
another
person
,
and
a
number
of
pauses
occur
in
the
conversation
,
he
regards
himself
as
a
failure
,
a
worthless
person
,
and
is
full
of
envy
of
the
emptiest-
headed
chatterbox
.
He
knows
that
ninety-nine
percent
of
human
conversation
means
no
more
than
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
,
but
he
is
anxious
to
join
in
the
buzz
and
to
prove
that
he
is
a
man
and
not
a
waxwork
figure
.
 
The
aim
of
conversation
is
not
,
for
the
most
part
,
to
communicate
ideas
;
it
is
to
keep
up
the
buzzing
sound
.
There
are
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
different
qualities
of
buzz
;
there
is
even
a
buzz
that
is
as
annoying
as
the
continuous
noise
made
by
a
mosquito
?
But
at
a
dinner
party
one
would
rather
be
a
mosquito
than
a
quiet
person
.
Most
buzzing
,
fortunately
,
is
pleasant
to
the
ear
,
and
some
of
it
is
pleasant
even
to
the
mind
.
He
would
be
a
foolish
man
if
he
waited
until
he
had
a
wise
thought
to
take
part
in
the
buzzing
with
his
neighbors
.
 
Those
who
hate
to
pick
up
the
weather
as
a
conversational
opening
seem
to
me
not
to
know
the
reason
why
human
beings
wish
to
talk
.
Very
few
human
beings
join
in
a
conversation
in
the
hope
of
learning
anything
new
.
Some
of
them
are
satisfied
if
they
are
only
allowed
to
go
on
making
a
noise
into
other
people
's
ears
,
though
they
have
nothing
to
tell
them
except
that
they
have
seen
two
or
three
new
plays
or
that
they
had
food
in
a
Swiss
hotel
.
At
the
end
of
an
evening
during
which
they
have
said
nothing
meaningful
for
a
long
time
,
they
just
prove
themselves
to
be
successful
conservationists

"A
thief
who
dropped
a
winning
lottery
ticket
at
the
scene
of
his
crime
has
been
given
a
lesson
in
honesty
.
His
victim
,
who
picked
up
the
ticket
,
then
claimed
the
PS25000
prize
,
managed
to
trace
him
,
and
handed
over
the
cash
.
The
robbery
happened
when
maths
professor
Vinicio
Sabbatucci,58
,
was
changing
a
tyre
on
an
Italian
motorway
.
Another
motorist
,
who
stopped
""
to
help
""
,
stole
a
suitcase
from
his
car
and
drove
off
.
The
professor
found
the
dropped
ticket
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
before
driving
home
to
Ascoli
in
eastern
Italy
.
 
Next
day
,
he
saw
the
lottery
results
on
TV
and
,
taking
out
the
ticket
,
realized
it
was
a
winner
.
He
claimed
the
60
million
lire
prize
.
Then
he
began
a
battle
with
his
conscience
.
Finally
,
he
decided
he
could
not
keep
the
money
despite
having
been
robbed
.
He
advertised
in
newspapers
and
on
radio
,
saying
:
""
I
'm
trying
to
find
the
man
who
robbed
me
.
I
have
60
million
for
him
--
-
a
lottery
win
.
Please
meet
me
.
Anonymity
guaranteed
.
""
 
Professor
Sabbatucci
received
hundreds
of
calls
from
people
hoping
to
trick
him
into
handing
them
the
cash
.
But
there
was
one
voice
he
recognized
--
-
and
he
arranged
to
meet
the
man
in
a
park
.
The
robber
,
a
35-year-old
unemployed
father
of
two
,
gave
back
the
suitcase
and
burst
into
tears
.
He
could
not
believe
what
was
happening
.
""
Why
did
n't
you
keep
the
money
?
""
he
asked
.
The
professor
replied
:
""
I
could
n't
because
it
's
not
mine
.
""
Then
he
walked
off
,
spurning
the
thief
's
offer
of
a
reward

"Big
Brothers
Big
Sisters
is
based
on
the
simplicity
and
power
of
friendship
.
It
is
a
program
which
provides
friendship
and
fun
by
matching
vulnerable
young
people
(
ages
7-17
)
with
a
volunteer
adult
who
can
be
both
a
role
model
and
a
supportive
friend
.
 
Volunteer
tutors
come
from
all
walks
of
life
--
married
,
single
,
with
or
without
children
.
Big
Brothers
and
Big
Sisters
are
not
replacement
parents
or
social
workers
.
They
are
tutors
:
someone
to
trust
,
to
have
fun
with
,
to
talk
and
go
to
when
needed
.
 
A
Big
Sister
and
Little
Sister
will
generally
spend
between
one
and
four
hours
together
three
or
four
times
each
month
for
at
least
twelve
months
.
They
enjoy
simple
activities
such
as
a
picnic
at
a
park
,
cooking
,
playing
sport
or
going
to
a
football
match
.
These
activities
improve
the
friendship
and
help
the
young
person
develop
positive
self-respect
,
confidence
and
life
direction
.
 
Big
Brothers
Big
Sisters
organizations
exist
throughout
the
world
.
It
is
the
largest
and
most
well-known
provider
of
tutor
services
internationally
and
has
been
operating
for
25
years
.
 
Emily
and
Sarah
have
been
matched
since
March
2008
.
Emily
is
a
10-year-old
girl
who
has
experienced
some
difficulties
being
accepted
by
her
schoolmates
at
school
.
""
I
was
pretty
sure
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
.
""
 
Emily
's
mum
came
across
Big
Brothers
Big
Sisters
and
thought
it
would
be
of
benefit
to
Emily
by
""
providing
different
feedback
about
herself
other
than
just
relying
on
schoolmates
to
measure
her
self-worth.
""
 
Sarah
wanted
to
get
involved
in
a
volunteer
program
.
""
I
paid
close
attention
to
it
and
found
out
how
to
be
a
part
of
it
.
I
thought
it
would
be
fun
for
me
to
get
involved
in
making
time
to
do
something
because
sometimes
it
's
all
work
and
no
play
.
""
 
Big
Brothers
Big
Sisters
has
been
of
great
benefit
and
enjoyment
to
both
Emily
and
Sarah
.
They
love
and
look
forward
to
their
time
together
and
the
partnership
has
certainly
helped
Emily
be
more
comfortable
in
being
the
wonderful
,
happy
and
unique
girl
she
is

"Jean
Francis
Grander
was
perhaps
the
most
daring
man
who
ever
lived
and
perhaps
the
craziest
.
His
greatest
desire
was
to
entertain
and
amaze
people
.
He
measured
his
success
by
the
number
of
people
who
fainted
dead
away
after
witnessing
his
death-defying
feats
.
 
Grander
,
a
blond
Frenchman
,
toured
North
America
in
1850
,
billing
himself
as
""
Blondin
""
.
Blondin
's
gift
was
excellent
balance
.
This
talent
.
coupled
with
a
great
desire
to
surprise
and
shock
his
audiences
,
made
Blondin
an
incomparable
performer
.
 
His
most
famous
feat
was
walking
acrossprefix
=
st1
/Niagara
Fallson
a
tightrope
.
Blondin
's
""
stage
""
consisted
of
a
rope
tied
1,100
feet
across
the
falls
.
The
rope
hung
some
160
feet
above
the
rocks
and
boiling
water
below
the
falls
.
 
Simply
walking
across
the
falls
was
not
exciting
enough
for
Blondin
;
he
later
had
to
ride
across
on
a
bicycle
.
Then
,
in
another
performance
,
he
calmly
walked
across
blindfolded
.
At
still
another
time
,
he
carried
his
terrified
manager
on
his
back
and
walked
over
the
falls
before
thousands
of
breathless
audience
.
 
But
Blondin
was
undoubtedly
his
own
worst
critic
.
He
was
never
satisfied
with
hfs
act
and
always
tried
to
attract
his
audience
with
his
balancing
feat
.
One
of
his
most
daring
walks
was
made
in
the
darkness
of
night
.
Blondin
became
so
famous
on
his
tour
through
North
America
that
his
last
performance
was
attended
by
an
admiring
Prince
of
Wales

"Little

He
missed
her
very
much
.
One
afternoon
Mike
went
to
the
city
park

There
he
saw
an
old
lady
.
She
looked
very
kind
.
She
was
sitting
there
,
watching
pigeons
.
Little
Mike
went
up
and
sat
next
to
her
.
He
took
out
his
food
and
drinks
and
gave
some
to
her
.
She
smiled
at
him
and
seemed
to
like
him
.
Her
smile
was
so
sweet
,
just
like
Mike
's
grandma
's
.
Mike
was
very
happy
.
 
They
sat
there
all
the
afternoon
,
eating
and
talking
.
When
it
's
getting
dark
,
Mike
had
to
go
home
.
Before
he
left
,
he
hugged
the
old
lady
and
she
gave
him
her
sweetest
smile
.
 
When
Mike
got
home
,
he
said
to
his
mother
,
""
I
met
a
granny
in
the
park
.
Her
smile
was
like
grandma
's
.
""
 
The
old
lady
also
went
back

happily

She
told
her
son
that
she
had
food

drinks
with
a
little
boy

""
He
was
so
lovely
just
like
Brittany

happy

her
grandson

"UNICEF
reports
that
40
million
children
below
the
age
of
15
suffer
from
abuse
and
neglect
.
The
USA
National
Committee
to
Prevent
Child
Abuse
finds
3
million
new
reports
of
child
abuse
or
neglect
every
year
.
 
According
to
such
information
on
human
rights
abuses
of
children
,
the
United
Nations
declared
2010
as
the
International
Year
of
Youth
.
In
answer
to
the
common
human
rights
abuses
of
young
people
,
Dr.
Mary
Shuttleworth
of
Youth
for
Human
Rights
International
(
YHRI
)
recently
completed
her
seventh
annual
World
Tour
to
five
continents
in
eighty
days
.
The
purpose
of
the
tour
is
to
promote
the
 
to
tens
of
thousands
of
children
and
officials
.
 
According
to
UNICEF
,
1.2
million
children
are
illegally
traded
all
over
the
world
every
year
.
 
Sold
as
goods
,
these
children
are
forced
into
inhuman
labor
,
denied
basic
education
and
robbed
of
their
childhoods
.
Youth
who
do
not
know
their
rights
are
easily
cheated
by
ill-intentioned
men
.
That
is
why
YHRI
thinks
highly
of
education
.
 
""
When
the
United
Nations
declared
2010
as
the
International
Year
of
Youth
,
I
knew
that
their
human
rights
had
to
be
greater
than
ever
,
""
Dr.
Shuttleworth
said
.
The
tour
reached
Mexico
,
Guatemala
,
Panama
,
Ecuador
,
Brazil
,
South
Africa
,
Swaziland
,
Portugal
,
Sardinia
,
Sicily
,
Italy
,
Greece
,
Taiwan
,
Japan
,
Hawaii
and
Los
Angeles
.
 
The
YHRI
World
Tour
2010
has
reached
tens
of
thousands
of
students
as
well
as
officials
,
educators
,
and
religious
leaders
and
thus
promotes
human

education
to
millions

"Linda
and
Lucy
were
best
friends
.
They
graduated
from
high
school
and
went
to
the
same
college
for
further
studies
.
 
After
some
days
Linda
found
that
her
friend
was
behaving
strangely
.
She
would
remain
quiet
,
sleep
too
much
and
turn
wild
,
very
often
.
At
first
,
Linda
thought
it
was
just
because
of
the
problems
she
had
met
in
her
studies
.
However
,
Lucy
became
even
stranger
over
time
.
Finally
,
Linda
could
n't
take
it
any
longer
and
asked
Lucy
about
her
strange
behavior
.
Lucy
broke
into
tears
and
said
that
she
was
going
around
with
a
boy
,
who
was
taking
drugs
and
forcing
her
to
take
them
,
too
.
 
Linda
was
shocked
by
her
story
.
She
then
advised
her
friend
to
leave
the
boy
.
She
reminded
Lucy
of
her
dreams
of
becoming
a
successful
doctor
and
encouraged
her
to
set
an
example
for
others
.
She
also
reminded
her
of
how
her
parents
would
feel
if
they
found
out
what
their
daughter
was
up
to
.
Through
her
efforts
,
Lucy
was
finally
able
to
leave
the
boy
and
drugs
.
During
this
time
,
her
friend
always
stood
by
her
.
 
Finally
,
the
two
friends
graduated
and
their
friendship
grew
stronger
.
They
both
became
successful
doctors
,
but
never
let
each
other
down
by
getting
into
bad
habits
.
They
lived
happily
as
close
friends
.
 
From
the
story
we
can
know
that
true
friends
are
those
who
encourage
you
to
become
the
best
you
can
ever
be
.
They
believe
in
you
and
will
never
leave
you

"Medicine
comes
in
lots
of
different
packages
.
Painkillers
in
a
tablet
can
make
your
headache
go
away
.
Antibiotic
cream
from
a
tube
can
prevent
your
cuts
from
becoming
infected
.
But
can
medicine
come
packaged
in
chicken
eggs
?
 
A
team
of
scientists
from
Scotland
say
""
yes
""
.
They
've
engineered
special
chickens
that
lay
eggs
with
disease-treating
drugs
inside
.
 
These
eggs
come
from
chickens
that
have
been
engineered
to
produce
certain
drugs
inside
their
egg
whites
.
 
These
drugs
are
made
of
molecules
called
proteins
.
Animals
make
thousands
of
proteins
--
they
're
the
main
element
in
skin
,
hair
,
milk
and
meat
.
Since
animals
can
make
proteins
easily
,
they
're
good
candidates
for
making
protein
drugs
.
 
Researchers
have
already
made
cows
,
sheep
and
goats
produce
protein
drugs
in
their
milk
.
But
chickens
are
cheaper
to
take
care
of
,
need
less
room
,
and
grow
faster
than
these
other
animals
.
Those
qualities
could
make
chickens
a
better
choice
to
become
living
drug
factories
,
says
Simon
Lillico
of
the
Roslin
Institute
near
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
.
 
Lillico
and
a
team
of
researchers
changed
chickens
'
DNA
--
the
code
that
tells
cells
how
to
make
proteins
--
so
that
the
birds
'
cells
made
two
protein
drugs
.
One
drug
can
treat
skin
cancer
,
and
the
other
treats
a
nerve
disease
called
multiple
sclerosis
.
 
The
scientists
changed
the
chickens
'
DNA
so
that
the
birds
made
these
drugs
only
in
their
egg
whites
.
This
protects
the
chickens
'
bodies
from
the
drugs
'
possible
harmful
effects
and
makes
it
easy
for
scientists
to
collect
the
drugs

"friend
was
n't
around

Here
's
our
advice
to
her
--
--
and
to
all
kids
who
feel
lonely
sometimes
.
 
It
's
hard
when
a
best
friend
is
n't
around
--
--
maybe
because
she
moved
to
a
different
school
or
a
different
class
.
You
may
feel
lonely
at
break
or
lunchtime
.
You
want
to
have
new
friends
,
but
how
do
you
make
them
?
Maybe
it
seems
like
everybody
else
already
has
their
friends
.
But
remember
,
there
's
always
room
for
more
friends
.
 
Start
by
looking
around
your
classroom
--
--
think
about
which
kids
you
'd
like
to
play
with
at
break
.
Look
for
chances
to
say
hi
to
them
,
smile
,
and
be
friendly
.
Offer
to
share
something
or
express
your
appreciation
to
them
.
Invite
someone
to
play
with
you
or
say
""
Do
you
want
to
sit
here
?
""
in
the
lunchroom
.
When
you
're
at
break
,
walk
over
to
kids
you
want
to
play
with
,
act
friendly
,
and
say
""
Hi
,
can
I
play
,
too
?
""
or
just
join
in
.
 
If
you
have
trouble
doing
_
or
if
you
're
feeling
shy
,
ask
your
teacher
to
help
you
make
new
friends
.
Teachers
are
usually
pretty
good
at
matching
up
friends
.
The
best
way
to
make
friends
is
to
be
a
friend
.
Be
kind
,
be
friendly
,
share
,
say
nice
things
,
offer
to
help
--
--
and
pretty
soon
,
you
'll
have
one
,
or
two
,
or
even
more
new
friends
.
 
You
might
still
miss
that
special
best
friend
.
But
when
you
see
each
other
,
you
can
share
something
you
did
n't
have
before
she
left
:
You
can
introduce
her
to
your
new
friends

"Now
that
America
has
declared
a
state
of
swine
flu
public
health
emergency
,
you
may
be
asking
yourself
--
what
am
Isupposed
to
do
?
Here
is
a
list
of
practical
steps
you
can
take
to
prepare
and
protect
yourself
and
your
family
.
 
1
)
Know
the
symptoms
--
Here
are
some
of
the
symptoms
that
sound
like
swine
flu
--
fevers
over
100
degrees
(
37.8degC
)
,
body
aches
,
cough
,
runny
nose
,
and
sometimes
,
nausea
and
diarrhea
.
It
's
also
useful
to
know
if
you
might
have
had
an
exposure
either
by
recent
travel
to
Mexico
,
or
to
the
areas
of
known
cases
so
far
in
America
--
specific
areas
of
California
,
Texas
,
New
York
,
Ohio
and
Kansas
.
Or
you
may
have
been
exposed
to
a
sick
person
who
came
from
those
areas
.
 
2
)
Do
n't
panic
--
If
you
have
symptoms
that
sound
like
swine
flu
,
do
not
rush
to
hospitals
.
Not
only
is
this
difficult
for
the
healthcare
system
,
it
can
also
be
potentially
dangerous
for
everyone
.
Call
your
doctor
or
local
public
health
clinic
before
going
in
.
 
3
)
Contain
the
illness
--
Hand-washing
works
.
Wash
,
wash
and
wash
.
Invest
in
some
hand
sanitizer
for
the
whole
family
.
Avoid
hugs
and
kisses
of
well-wishers
,
and
do
not
share
telephone
handsets
or
computers
.
Be
especially
careful
to
always
cough
into
the
elbow
of
your
arm
(
yes
!
the
elbow
,
not
your
hand
!
)
.
Cover
your
cough
and
sneeze
to
protect
others
.
 
4
)
What
about
a
mask
?
--
The
data
shows
that
masks
do
work
--
as
long
asthere
is
a
tight
seal
about
the
mouth
and
nose
.
 
5
)
Eat
the
pork
(
if
you
want
)
--
Swine
flu
gets
its
name
because
pigs
can
get
the
infection
and
spread
it
to
each
other
--
as
well
as
to
humans
.
This
latest
virus
contains
pieces
that
indicate
it
evolved
from
swine
flu
virus
,
and
can
now
spread
from
person
to
person
.
Swine
flu
is
not
spread
by
properly
prepared
and
cooked
pork
products
.
So
if
you
want
to
eat
pork
,
you
can
.
 
6
)
Getting
sick
?
Stay
home
!
--
In
our
go-go-go
culture
and
these
severe
economic
times
,
it
can
be
very
hard
to
call
a
boss
and
cancel
a
day
's
work
.
Now
,
however
,
if
you
or
your
loved
ones
are
feeling
like
there
's
a
flu
coming
on
,
stay
home
.
 
7
)
Stockpile
?
--
Right
now
,
it
's
too
early
for
any
of
us
to
become
a
Swine
Flu
Shut-In
,
but
the
public
health
department
recommends
that
each
home
have
two
weeks
of
supplies
,
in
case
we
must
stay
home
--
either
for
illness
or
to
help
contain
transmission
.
That
means
two
weeks
of
food
for
everyone
in
your
home
,
two
weeks
of
all
medications
,
and
,
if
you
're
like
most
people
,
two
weeks
of
books
and
DVDs
."	"1

"Nigel
received
a
reward
for
his
excellence
in
study
.
It
began
when
he
was
selected
to
help
the
teachers
in
the
computer
laboratories
.
 
The
peak
of
his
school
career
came
not
when
he
topped
the
school
but
when
he
was
selected
for
the
nationwide
competition
.
Unlike
everyone
else
,
Nigel
wanted
to
join
the
contest
because
he
liked
making
something
out
of
the
Lego
sets
.
Nigel
spent
the
next
two
months
rebuilding
the
robot
.
It
was
during
the
time
that
Nigel
found
out
about
the
prizes
for
the
competition
as
well
as
another
competitor
,
Alicia
,
from
a
neighboring
school
.
His
early
intentions
were
forgotten
.
Getting
the
thousand-dollar
prize
was
more
important
than
anything
else
.
Nigel
decided
to
befriend
Alicia
.
Unaware
of
his
intentions
,
she
told
him
all
about
the
robot
that
she
had
been
building
for
the
competition
.
He
even
helped
her
to
put
the
finishing
branches
to
her
robot
.
He
was
glad
with
the
way
things
had
progressed
.
His
robot
was
able
to
become
a
ball
with
its
arms
,
which
Alicia
had
failed
to
do
.
 
Everything
did
n't
dawn
on
her
until
she
saw
him
among
the
competition
.
She
stared
at
him
,
puzzled
at
first
,
then
angry
and
finally
a
look
of
helplessness
came
over
her
.
 
The

"Woody
Guthrie
left
California
for
New
York
in
1940
.
There
he
met
Alan
Lomax
,
an
expert
on
America
's
traditional
music
.
He
collected
and
recorded
traditional
American
folk
music
,
which
had
few
fans
at
that
time
.
When
he
heard
Woody
sing
,
Lomax
knew
he
had
found
a
true
singer
of
American
folk
music
.
Lomax
recorded
many
of
Woody
's
songs
for
the
Library
of
Congress
.
 
Three
years
later
,
Woody
published
a
book
called
Bound
for
Glory
.
It
was
about
his
early
life
and
travels
.
From
this
book
people
came
to
learn
how
Woody
had
spent
his
unhappy
youth
.
His
mother
,
Nora
Guthrie
,
died
of
Huntington
's
Disease
in
1929
when
he
was
only
seventeen
years
old
.
There
was
no
treatment
for
the
disease
.
About
twenty
years
later
,
the
disease
also
began
to
attack
the
son
.
Woody
's
health
got
worse
and
worse
,
and
finally
he
entered
a
hospital
.
 
While
Woody
seemed
to
be
forgotten
,
his
music
was
not
.
By
the
late
1950s
,
folk
music
became
popular
in
America
.
More
Americans
began
listening
and
playing
the
songs
of
Woody
Guthrie
.
Young
folk
singers
came
to
New
York
to
visit
Woody
in
the
hospital
.
Among
them
was
Bob
Dylan
,
one
of
America
's
greatest
popular
songwriters
.
He
called
Woody
his
hero
.
Dylan
and
others
copied
the
way
Woody
sang
and
played
the
guitar
.
And
like
Woody
,
they
wrote
songs
that
called
for
social
and
political
justice
.
 
Woody
Guthrie
stayed
in
the
hospital
until
he
died
in
1967
.
In
the
last
years
of
his
life
,
Woody
could
hardly
speak
.
But
his
family
and
friends
knew
he
still
believed
in
the
causes
he
had
sung
and
written
about
all
his
life
.
They
knew
this
because
when
they
sang
his
songs
,
Woody
's
eyes
would
become
brighter
and
his
defiant
spirit
would
shine
through

who
also
raises
pets
online
.
 
If
you
go
to
some
websites
,
you
can
adopt
virtual
pets
like
penguins
,
chickens
,
dogs
and
elephants
.
You
can
feed
,
wash
,
talk
to
and
play
with
your
pet
.
 
Dai
Yingshuang
of
Shanghai
raises
pets
on
KaixinOOl
.
com
.
The
15-year-old
girl
said
it
is
great
fun
.
She
thinks
that
she
has
also
learned
how
to
take
care
of
others
.
 
If
one
does
n't
feed
and
care
for
the
pet
,
it
becomes
unhappy
and
unhealthy
.
So
raising
an
online
pet
means
spending
a
lot
of
time
online
.
 
This
makes
many
parents
worried
.
They
fear
there
will
be
bad
influence
in
the
children
's
studies
.
 
Dai
said
that
she
usually
asks
her
uncle
to
take
care
of
her
pet
,
while
she
is
at
school
.
 
Wang
Zhaotong
,
from
Anhui
,
has
been
raising
a
penguin
on
QQ
.
com
since
last
year
.
The
14-year-old
girl
takes
good
care
of
the
penguin
.
 
She
said
her
parents
knew
about
the
penguin
and
think
it
's
Okay
.
If
the
students
can
keep
the
balance
between
studying
and
playing
,
it
's
not
bad
for
them
to
""
raise
""
pets
online

"Former
Hollywood
child
star
Shirley
Temple
died
on
Monday
at
home
in
Woodside
,
California
,
from
natural
causes
.
""
She
was
surrounded
by
her
family
and
caregivers
,
""
a
statement
said
.
 
With
her
adorable
charm
and
blonde
curls
,
she
was
one
of
the
most
popular
stars
of
the
1930s
,
in
hit
movies
like
Bright
Eyes
and
Stand
Up
and
Cheer
.
Her
singing
,
dancing
and
acting
won
over
fans
worldwide
.
She
was
given
a
special
teenager
Oscar
in
1935
,
when
she
was
just
six
years
old
.
To
this
day
,
she
is
still
the
youngest
person
to
receive
an
Academy
Award
.
 
After
retiring
from
films
in
1950
at
the
age
of
21
,
Temple
returned
to
the
spotlight
as
a
politician
and
diplomat
.
Shirley
Temple
started
her
film
career
at
three
years
old
.
Between
1934
and
1938
she
appeared
in
more
than
20
feature
films
and
was
consistently
the
top
US
movie
star
.
The
youngster
wore
a
grass
skirt
and
played
a
Ukulele
to
promote
the
musical
Captain
January
,
directed
by
David
Butler
,
in
1936
.
She
attended
her
first
big
premiere
for
her
film
Wee
Willie
Winkie
in
Hollywood
on
26
June
,
1937
.
 
As
well
as
being
the
youngest
ever
receiver
of
an
Oscar
(
at
the
age
of
6
years
and
310
days
)
,
Temple
was
also
the
youngest
person
to
present
one
of
the
statuettes
.
She
stood
on
a
chair
to
give
Claudette
Colbert
the
best
actress
prize
for
It
Happened
One
Night
in
1935
.
At
the
age
of
12
Temple`s
star
burnt
out
-
her
parents
bought
out
the
remainder
of
her
contract
and
sent
her
to
a
girl`s
school
.
Her
final
film
,
A
Kiss
For
Corliss
,
is
available
to
watch
online
for
free
.
This
is
star`s
final
ever
moment
on
the
big
screen
.
The
actress
retired
from
Hollywood
in
1950
,
but
she
still
appeared
occasionally
on
TV
.
In
1958
she
wore
a
fairy
godmother
costume
to
promote
her
series
of
dramatised
fairy
tales
,
Shirley
Temple`s
Storybook
.
In
2006
,
she
accepted
the
Life
Achievement
Award
at
the
12th
Annual
Screen
Actors
Guild
Awards

"My
father
's
family
is
not
a
musical
family
.
They
are
a
family
of
words
.
My
brother
has
my
father
's
dark
hair
,
his
love
of
a
good
argument
.
I
take
after
my
mother
.
From
her
I
inherited
a
curious
nature
,
a
sense
of
adventure
,
bright
red
hair
.
I
did
not
,
contrary
to
her
hopes
,
inherit
a
talent
for
the
piano
.
That
fact
was
established
beyond
doubt
after
unsuccessful
attempts
to
draw
music
from
me
.
 
The
piano
lessons
began
when
I
was
four
.
My
mother
was
convinced
that
I
would
be
a
child
Mozart
.
She
found
the
ideal
teacher-Madame
Oblenka
,
a
strict
Russian
woman
,
whose
pursed
lips
were
enough
to
frighten
a
wild
horse
into
submission
.
Madame
Oblenka
,
who
expected
a
little
Mozart
,
was
not
very
delighted
to
find
a
little
girl
banging
her
fists
on
the
keys
.
 
I
tried
to
please
her
.
""
Feel
the
music
,
""
she
urged
.
I
""
felt
""
it
and
winced
my
ears-for
what
is
more
unpleasant
than
a
series
of
wrong
notes
played
continuously
?
She
""
felt
""
my
music
,
too
,
which
is
why
she
always
left
with
an
angrier
expression
than
when
she
came
.
 
Once
,
when
I
was
ten
,
I
managed
to
record
one
of
my
own
rehearsals
.
In
order
to
escape
my
practice
sessions
,
I
would
close
myself
behind
the
door
of
the
piano
room
,
put
on
the
tape
recording
,
and
read
until
the
tape
had
finished
.
That
method
worked
for
a
week
,
until
my
mother
began
to
wonder
why
I
always
missed
the
same
B-sharp
.
She
knocked
on
the
door
,
and
,
receiving
no
answer
,
came
in
to
check
on
me
and
found
that
I
had
fallen
asleep
while
the
tape
of
my
performance
played
on
and
on
.
 
I
was
twelve
when
my
parents
finally
acknowledged
that
my
hidden
talent
was
not
about
to
emerge
any
time
soon
.
My
mother
,
refusing
to
admit
defeat
,
told
me
to
pick
another
instrument
.
""
Choose
anything
you
want
,
Honey
,
""
she
said
,
assuming
that
freedom
of
choice
would
inspire
devotion
.
I
thought
long
and
hard
and
chose
the
drums
.
My
parents
,
sensitive
to
noise
,
would
be
less
than
overjoyed
by
a
daily
bombardment
of
playing
.
I
imagined
my
father
in
his
study
,
cotton
wads
in
his
ears
.
 
I
worked
my
way
through
several
other
instruments
before
my
mother
hit
on
another
idea
.
Maybe
I
was
n't
meant
to
be
an
instrumentalist
.
Realizing
that
drama
might
be
more
suited
to
my
talents
,
Mom
took
me
to
a
drama
teacher
.
However
,
he
put
me
backstage
,
painting
scenery
.
Once
I
recovered
from
my
sense
of
injury
,
I
realized
the
wisdom
of
his
choice
.
I
loved
the
active
,
practical
backstage
world
,
and
I
discovered
that
I
had
a
knack
for
constructing
and
painting
.
I
loved
the
challenge
of
taking
our
scanty
supplies
and
using
them
to
make
something
beautiful
.
Imagining
a
scene
and
then
seeing
it
emerge
before
me-this
,
to
me
,
was
close
to
magic
.
 
I
'm
a
sculptor
now
,
and
every
day
I
experience
afresh
the
joy
of
being
fully
absorbed
in
the
act
of
artistic
creation
.
It
's
a
wonderful
,
blissful
feeling
.
I
realize
that
my
parents
,
in
their
misguided
attempts
to
interest
me
in
music
,
were
trying
to
give
me
this
feeling
.
And
now
I
feel
grateful
.
Perhaps
they
went
about
it
in
the
wrong
way
,
but
their
hearts
were
in
the
right
place

"When
you
were
very
young
,
you
liked
to
play
with
your
friends
.
Did
you
find
that
playtime
was
always
more
fun
when
everyone
shared
the
toys
?
Everyone
got
a
turn
.
No
one
was
left
out
.
 
That
's
a
life
lesson
that
changes
as
you
get
older
.
As
you
grow
up
,
you
begin
to
understand
that
others
have
less
than
you
do
-
in
China
and
in
the
world
.
And
that
those
of
us
who
""
have
""
things
should
help
those
who
""
have
less
""
than
we
do
.
The
idea
of
sharing
makes
a
great
difference
.
 
At
your
age
,
you
can
""
share
""
with
people
in
need
in
three
ways
.
 
1
.
You
can
give
them
a
part
of
your
money
.
Many
adults
do
that
regularly
.
 
2
.
You
can
share
items
you
no
longer
use
,
such
as
clothing
and
toys
.
You
can
pass
them
onto
others
who
can
not
buy
them
.
 
3
.
You
can
help
people
by
giving
your
time
and
your
energy
.
 
The
last
one
is
also
called
volunteering
.
Volunteering
is
about
giving
your
time
to
take
part
in
activities
that
will
help
others
.
Every
year
,
many
thousands
of
volunteers
in
the
world
give
the
most
valuable
gift
of
all
.
They
give
their
time
.
They
give
their
talent
.
They
give
of
themselves
.
And
they
are
enjoying
it
.
Volunteering
is
n't
just
about
work
.
It
's
about
fun
too
.

"While
Americans
feel
worried
about
how
to
look
after
their
children
and
help
them
grow
,
French
parents
are
raising
happy
,
well-behaved
children
without
all
the
anxiety
.
 
Pamela
Druckerman
,
an
American
mother
living
in
Paris
,
watched
carefully
as
to
why
French
children
seem
to
behave
so
much
better
than
American
children
.
Let
's
listen
to
what
she
said
.
 
While
eating
at
the
restaurants
in
Paris
,
I
noticed
the
French
kids
were
either
sitting
in
their
chairs
waiting
for
their
food
or
eating
fish
and
even
vegetables
,
happy
and
satisfied
.
There
was
no
shouting
or
crying
,
and
there
were
no
pieces
of
food
around
their
tables
.
However
,
my
2-year-old
daughter
,
Beth
,
took
a
brief
interest
in
the
food
.
She
even
threw
food
everywhere
.
She
could
n't
keep
herself
in
her
chair
and
ran
around
the
table
.
Though
by
that
time
I
'd
live
in
France
for
a
few
months
,
I
could
n't
explain
it
.
 
After
surveying
French
parents
,
I
realized
that
they
are
n't
perfect
,
but
they
have
some
parenting
secrets
that
do
work
.
French
parents
seem
to
have
different
ideas
about
raising
kids
.
One
of
the
keys
to
this
education
is
the
simple
act
of
learning
how
to
wait
.
It
is
why
the
French
babies
I
have
encountered
mostly
sleep
throughout
the
night
from
two
or
three
months
old
.
Their
parents
do
n't
pick
them
up
the
moment
they
start
crying
,
allowing
the
babies
to
learn
how
to
fall
back
asleep
.
It
is
also
why
French
kids
will
sit
happily
at
a
restaurant
.
Rather
than
snacking
all
day
like
American
children
,
they
mostly
have
to
wait
until
mealtime
to
eat
.
French
kids
always
have
three
meals
a
day
and
one
snack
at
about
4:00
pm
."	"319

"When
he
was
a
teenager
,
Hunter
Adam
was
very
unhappy
and
he
spent
many
years
in
a
special
hospital
for
people
with
mental
health
problems
.
 
When
he
left
the
hospital
,
Adam
decided
to
become
a
doctor
,
so
he
went
to
a
medical
school
in
Virginia
,
USA
.
But
when
he
was
there
,
he
did
things
in
a
different
way
.
For
example
,
he
did
n't
like
the
doctor
's
white
coats
,
so
he
wore
shirts
with
flowers
on
them
when
he
visited
his
patients
and
he
tried
to
make
them
laugh
.
The
doctors
at
the
medical
school
did
n't
like
Adams
because
he
was
too
different
.
 
But
Adams
believed
that
people
in
hospital
need
more
than
medicine
.
He
saw
unhappy
and
lonely
people
,
and
he
tried
to
help
them
as
patients
,
but
as
people
too
.
He
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
children
in
the
hospital
and
often
dressed
up
like
a
clown
to
make
the
children
laugh
 
When
he
finished
medical
school
and
become
a
doctor
,
Adams
opened
his
own
hospital
,
called
""
the
Gusundheit
Institute
""
,
together
with
some
other
doctors
.
They
wanted
it
to
be
a
place
with
a
different
way
of
working
with
sick
people
.
 
Hunter
Adams
became
famous
during
the
1980s
,
and
in
1988
,
Universal
Pictures
made
a
film
about
his
life
.
It
was
very
successful
.
In
the
film
,
Robin
Williams
played
Adams
.
Williams
said
,
:
""
hunter
is
a
really
warm
person
,
who
believes
that
patients
need
a
doctor
who
is
a
friend
.
I
enjoyed
playing
him

"Many
facts
suggest
that
children
are
overweight
and
the
situation
is
getting
worse
,
according
to
the
doctors
.
I
feel
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
this
.
 
Some
people
blame
the
fact
that
we
are
surrounded
by
shops
selling
unhealthy
,
fatty
foods
,
such
as
fried
chicken
and
ice
cream
,
at
low
prices
.
This
has
turned
out
a
whole
generation
of
grown-ups
who
seldom
cook
a
meal
for
themselves
.
If
there
were
fewer
of
these
restaurants
,
then
probably
children
would
buy
less
take-away
food
.
 
There
is
another
argument
that
blames
parents
for
allowing
their
children
to
become
overweight
.
I
agree
with
this
,
because
good
eating
habits
begin
early
in
life
,
long
before
children
start
to
visit
fast
food
shops
.
If
children
are
given
fried
chicken
and
chocolate
rather
than
healthy
food
,
or
are
always
allowed
to
choose
what
they
eat
,
they
will
go
for
sweet
and
salty
foods
every
time
,
and
this
will
carry
on
throughout
their
lives
.
 
There
is
a
third
reason
for
this
situation
.
Children
these
days
take
very
little
exercise
.
They
do
not
walk
to
school
.
When
they
get
home
,
they
sit
in
front
of
the
television
or
their
computers
and
play
computer
games
.
Not
only
is
this
an
unhealthy
pastime
,
it
also
gives
them
time
to
eat
more
unhealthy
food
.
What
they
need
is
to
go
outside
and
play
active
games
or
sports
.
 
The
above
are
the
main
reasons
for
this
problem
,
and
therefore
we
have
to
encourage
young
people
to
be
more
active
,
as
well
as
steering
them
away
from
fast
food
shops
and
bad
eating
habits

"On
the
first
day
of
the
sixth
grade
,
I
waited
at
the
bus
stop
for
the
school
bus
.
When
it
arrived
,
I
got
on
and
I
noticed
one
little
girl
called
Amy
.
She
was
different
from
everyone
else
on
the
bus
.
 
""
Do
n't
talk
to
Amy
,
""
warned
Lauren
,
who
sat
beside
me
.
""
Or
everybody
will
make
fun
of
you
.
""
 
Amy
had
many
physical
differences
and
the
other
kids
always
made
fun
of
her
.
Her
eyes
were
n't
straight
.
Her
glasses
were
an
inch
thick
.
And
she
had
really
strange
teeth
.
Every
day
kids
shouted
insults
at
Amy
.
They
would
say
,
""
God
,
what
a
strange
face
!
Stop
looking
at
me
!
""
 
For
a
while
I
shouted
insults
at
Amy
too
,
just
so
I
could
fit
in
.
After
all
,
I
did
n't
want
the
other
kids
treating
me
the
same
as
they
treated
Amy
.
But
it
made
me
sad
to
insult
her
.
I
could
see
that
the
insults
were
making
her
feel
ashamed
and
lonely
.
I
began
to
pity
her
.
Then
I
wanted
to
stand
up
for
her
.
I
did
n't
know
how
to
stop
my
schoolmates
insulting
Amy
until
the
night
of
our
class
skating
party
.
 
Our
whole
class
was
there
,
including
Amy
.
Amy
did
n't
know
how
to
skate
,
but
I
could
see
how
much
she
wanted
to
have
fun
like
the
rest
of
us
.
So
I
skated
over
to
her
and
took
her
by
the
hand
.
Holding
her
hand
,
I
slowly
pulled
her
,
and
together
we
began
the
journey
around
the
skating
rink
.
I
did
n't
say
a
word
to
her
,
and
she
did
n't
speak
to
me
.
She
just
smiled
,
and
every
once
in
a
while
she
would
laugh
in
excitement
.
 
The
next
morning
,
on
the
school
bus
the
other
kids
talked
a
lot
about
Amy
and
me
.
But
nobody
insulted
her
or
me
.
And
they
did
n't
do
that
for
the
rest
of
the
year
.
When
the
school
year
ended
,
my
family
moved
away
,
and
I
never
heard
of
Amy
again
.
But
I
've
always
hoped
that
I
changed
her
life
for
the
better
.
 
She
changed
my
life
as
well
.
After
becoming
her
friend
,
I
no
longer
tried
to
impress
people
by
trying
to
act
like
them
or
dress
like
them
.
I
became
myself

"You
've
heard
of
fast
food
,
but
what
about
slow
food
?
 
Slow
food
is
an
international
movement
.
It
promotes
home
cooking
,
and
the
use
of
fresh
,
unprocessed
produce
.
It
was
founded
as
reaction
to
the
popularity
of
unhealthy
fast
food
.
It
also
encourages
people
to
buy
food
from
local
businesses
,
rather
than
large
supermarkets
.
 
The
movement
began
in
1986.
at
that
time
,
McDonald
's
wanted
to
open
a
restaurant
in
the
centre
of
Rome
(
Italy
)
.
Food
writer
Carlo
Perini
,
along
with
others
,
was
against
this
.
So
,
the
Slow
Food
Organization
was
born
.
Today
,
it
has
overt
100,00
members
in
132
countries
.
And
its
symbol
is
one
of
the
world
's
slowest
moving
creatures
,
the
snail
.
The
organization
's
website
explains
,
""
The
snail
was
chosen
because
it
moves
slowly
,
and
calmly
eats
its
way
through
life
.
""
 
But
Slow
Food
is
n't
just
about
the
food
we
eat
.
It
's
also
about
how
we
eat
it
.
Slow
foodies
say
that
in
our
fast
-
food
world
with
very
little
time
,
we
've
forgotten
that
eating
should
be
a
social
activity
.
They
believe
families
should
eat
together
and
talk
,
rather
than
watch
TV
with
their
dinner
while
sitting
in
front
of
it
.
In
fact
,
research
has
shown
that
if
children
grow
up
in
a
family
that
eats
together
at
the
table
,
they
are
more
likely
to
do
well
in
school
,
and
less
likely
to
have
behavioral
problems
or
devel
op
eating
disorders
.
 
And
there
's
more
!
Slow
Food
has
sparked
an
entire
Slow
Food
Movement
.
This
encourages
people
to
slow
down
the
pace
of
their
busy
lives
.
And
now
,
within
the
movement
,
there
's
Slow
Money
,
Slow
Travel
,
Slow
Parenting
,
Slow
Art
and
Slow
Media
,
among
many
others
.
In
1999
The
World
Institute
of
Slowness
was
formed
.
One
of
the
Institute
's
slogans
is
a
quotation
by
the
famous
American
actress
Mae
West
.
She
said
,
""
Everything
worth
doing
in
life
,
is
worth
doing
slowly
.
""
Do
you
agree
?
No
need
to
answer
straight
away
.
Have
a
long
hard
think
about
it
.
Take
your
time
.
And
get
back
to
us
when
you
can

"A
Scottish
woman
has
given
birth
to
twins
for
the
third
time
.
Karen
Rodger
,
41
,
welcomed
her
first
pair
of
girls
rowan
and
Isla
after
having
twice
given
birth
to
twin
boys
.
 
""
I
still
have
n't
really
taken
it
on
board
because
I
was
convinced
I
was
having
two
boys
,
""
Rodger
told
Sky
News
.
Karen
said
her
husband
Colin
was
equally
stunned
when
the
couple
learned
they
were
going
to
have
their
fifth
and
sixth
child
.
""
He
thought
I
was
joking
and
immediately
wrote
back
to
say
'this
is
not
funny
'
.
I
had
to
explain
that
it
really
was
true
,
""
Karen
said
.
 
The
average
couple
has
about
a
3
percent
chance
of
having
twins
when
not
accounting
for
fertility
drugs
.
And
with
each
following
pregnancy
,
the
changes
of
producing
twins
a
second
,
or
even
third
time
,
become
less
.
 
Karen
,
a
dance
lecturer
,
first
learned
of
the
incredibly
rare
occurrence
during
a
visit
to
her
doctor
and
immediately
texted
her
husband
to
share
the
news
.
""
I
just
could
not
believe
it
.
It
never
crossed
my
mind
that
it
would
be
twins
again
.
I
just
thought
that
would
n't
happen
to
people
like
me
,
but
I
'm
ly
delighted
,
""
she
said
.
 
It
had
been
several
years
since
the
couple
's
last
children
were
born
.
Their
oldest
twins
are
14
and
the
second
set
was
born
just
two
years
later
.
""
I
turned
40
and
I
thought
,
if
I
'm
going
to
do
it
,
I
should
do
it
now
,
""
Karen
said
.
""
I
spoken
to
my
husband
and
we
both
thought
we
'd
quite
like
another
one
so
that
was
it
and
,
one
month
later
,
I
was
pregnant
.
""
 
Colin
says
the
age
and
gender
difference
will
ensure
a
sweat-inducing
dilemma
for
any
future
suitors
of
the
twin
girls
.
It
will
be
a
frightening
challenge
for
any
boyfriend

"Claressa
was
getting
ready
for
a
fight
.
She
had
boxed
many
times
before
.
But
this
time
,
the
prizes
were
higher
than
ever
.
If
she
won
this
fight
,
Claressa
would
win
a
spot
on
the
US
Olympic
Women
's
Boxing
Team
.
 
The
fight
was
difficult
.
Claressa
was
up
against
a
two-time
US
champion
.
""
Her
whole
game
plan
was
to
hold
me
against
the
ropes
so
I
would
n't
hit
her
,
""
says
Claressa
.
Claressa
did
n't
give
up
.
She
won
the
fight
.
And
that
was
n't
all
.
She
also
won
the
title
of
outstanding
fighter
for
the
whole
tournament
!
 
Claressa
,
now
17
,
started
boxing
when
she
was
just
11
.
She
was
inspired
by
her
dad
.
He
had
been
a
fighter
when
he
was
younger
.
But
when
she
first
told
her
dad
that
she
wanted
to
box
,
he
did
n't
support
her
.
""
He
told
me
,
'No
!
No
!
Boxing
is
a
man
's
sport
,
'
""
Claressa
remembers
.
""
It
made
me
so
mad
.
""
 
Claressa
would
n't
back
down
.
""
I
wanted
to
fight
.
I
knew
that
whatever
I
put
my
heart
and
my
work
into
,
I
was
going
to
be
successful
at
it
,
""
she
says
.
Finally
,
her
dad
took
her
to
the
boxing
gym
to
start
training
.
She
was
the
only
girl
.
""
Everybody
was
looking
at
me
,
""
she
says
.
 
Claressa
did
n't
worry
about
fitting
in
.
She
just
did
her
best
.
Claressa
now
has
a
boxing
record
of
23
wins
and
zero
losses
.
""
I
think
you
're
awesome
,
""
her
dad
told
her
not
long
ago
.
He
's
proud
that
she
proved
him
wrong
.
""
I
'm
still
proving
people
wrong
,
""
says
Claressa
.
 
Boxing
can
be
dangerous
.
How
does
Claressa
feel
when
she
steps
into
the
ring
?
""
I
'm
not
nervous
,
""
she
says
.
""
I
'm
determined
and
calm
.
""
She
knows
it
's
important
to
stay
confident
.
""
I
've
never
gotten
into
the
ring
thinking
that
a
girl
can
beat
me
,
""
she
adds
.
But
Claressa
takes
the
competition
seriously
.
""
I
always
tell
myself
it
's
going
to
be
harder
than
I
think
,
""
she
says
.
""
I
fight
them
all
like
they
are
world
champions
.
If
I
think
it
's
going
to
be
easy
,
I
'm
done
!
""
 
We
asked
Claressa
to
imagine
stepping
into
the
ring
at
the
Olympics
.
Would
it
feel
any
different
from
her
other
fights
?
""
No
,
""
she
says
.
""
Just
a
fight
.
Just
another
girl
in
my
way

"Jess
really
felt
very
happy
.
When
he
arrived
at
his
seat
in
the
classroom
that
morning
,
he
found
an
invitation
on
his
desk
.
It
was
from
some
of
his
classmates
asking
him
to
join
their
camping
trip
.
This
was
the
first
time
he
was
asked
to
join
in
an
out-of-school
activity
.
Why
were
they
asking
him
now
?
Nobody
seemed
to
like
him
.
In
fact
,
he
had
been
so
lonely
that
he
ate
a
lot
to
make
himself
feel
less
lonely
.
As
a
result
,
he
had
put
on
a
lot
of
weight
,
and
this
gave
the
children
something
more
to
make
fun
of
him
.
 
Cindy
,
who
was
standing
near
Jess
when
he
read
the
invitation
,
went
out
quickly
to
tell
the
others
that
the
trick
had
worked
.
Everyone
was
happy
that
Jess
thought
that
was
true
.
But
there
was
no
camping
trip
.
The
whole
thing
was
made
up
.
 
At
first
,
Cindy
thought
it
was
fun
.
But
later
,
when
Jess
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
buy
a
sleeping
bag
with
his
pocket
money
,
Cindy
had
a
second
idea
.
She
knew
that
Jess
's
family
had
little
money
,
and
she
hated
to
see
him
spend
his
pocket
money
on
something
he
would
never
use
.
Cindy
also
hated
to
tell
Jess
the
truth
.
Her
close
friends
would
be
unhappy
with
her
.
 
What
could
she
do
now

"No
one
is
sure
how
the
ancient
Egyptians
built
the
pyramids
near
Cairo
.
But
a
new
study
suggests
they
used
a
little
rock'n'roll
.
Long-ago
builders
could
have
attached
wooden
poles
to
the
stones
and
rolled
them
across
the
sand
,
the
scientists
say
.
 
""
Technically
,
I
think
what
they
're
proposing
is
possible
,
""
physicist
Daniel
Bonn
said
.
 
People
have
long
puzzled
over
how
the
Egyptians
moved
such
huge
rocks
.
And
there
's
no
obvious
answer
.
On
average
,
each
of
the
two
million
big
stones
weighed
about
as
much
as
a
large
pickup
truck
.
The
Egyptians
somehow
moved
the
stone
blocks
to
the
pyramid
site
from
about
one
kilometer
away
.
 
The
most
popular
view
is
that
Egyptian
workers
slid
the
blocks
along
smooth
paths
.
Many
scientists
suspect
wokers
first
would
have
put
the
blocks
on
sleds
.
Then
they
would
have
dragged
them
along
paths
.
To
make
the
work
easier
,
workers
may
have
lubricated
the
paths
either
with
wet
clay
or
with
the
fat
from
cattle
.
Bonn
has
now
tested
this
idea
by
building
small
sleds
and
dragging
heavy
objects
over
sand
.
 
Evidence
from
the
sand
supports
this
idea
.
Researchers
found
small
amounts
of
fat
,
as
well
as
a
large
amount
of
stone
and
the
remains
of
paths
.
 
However
,
physicist
Joseph
West
think
there
might
have
been
a
simpler
way
,
who
led
the
new
study
.
West
said
,
""
I
was
inspired
while
watching
a
television
program
showing
how
sleds
might
have
helped
with
pyramid
construction
.
I
thought
,
""
Why
do
n't
they
just
try
rolling
the
things
?
""
A
square
could
be
turned
into
a
rough
sort
of
wheel
by
attaching
wooden
poles
to
its
sides
,
he
realized
.
That
,
he
notes
,
should
make
a
block
of
stone
""
a
lot
easier
to
roll
than
a
square
""
.
 
So
he
tried
it
.
 
He
and
his
students
tied
some
poles
to
each
of
four
sides
of
a
30-kilogram
stone
block
.
That
action
turned
the
block
into
somewhat
a
wheel
.
Then
they
placed
the
block
on
the
ground
.
 
They
wrapped
one
end
of
a
rope
around
the
block
and
pulled
.
The
researchers
found
they
could
easily
roll
the
block
along
different
kinds
of
paths
.
They
calculated
that
rolling
the
block
required
about
as
much
force
as
moving
it
along
a
slippery
path
.
 
West
has
n't
tested
his
idea
on
larger
blocks
,
but
he
thinks
rolling
has
clear
advantages
over
sliding
.
At
least
,
workers
would
n't
have
needed
to
carry
cattle
fat
or
water
to
smooth
the
paths

"A
traveler
came
out
of
the
airport
.
There
were
a
lot
of
taxis
.
He
asked
every
taxi
driver
about
his
name
.
Then
he
took
the
third
one
.
It
cost
5
dollars
from
the
airport
to
the
hotel
.
""
How
much
does
it
cost
for
the
whole
day
?
""
The
man
asked
.
""
100
dollars
,
""
said
the
taxi
driver
.
This
was
very
dear
,
but
the
man
said
it
was
OK
.
 
The
taxi
driver
took
the
man
everywhere
.
He
showed
him
all
the
parks
and
museums
in
the
city
.
In
the
evening
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
.
The
traveler
gave
the
taxi
driver
100
dollars
and
said
,
""
What
about
tomorrow
?
""
The
taxi
driver
looked
at
the
man
and
said
,
""
Tomorrow
is
another
100
dollars
.
""
And
the
man
said
,
""
That
's
OK
!
See
you
tomorrow
.
""
The
taxi
driver
was
very
pleased
.
 
The
next
day
the
taxi
driver
took
the
traveler
everywhere
again
.
They
visited
all
the
parks
and
museums
again
.
And
in
the
evening
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
.
The
man
gave
the
taxi
driver
100
dollars
again
and
said
,
""
I
'm
going
home
tomorrow
.
""
The
driver
was
sorry
because
he
liked
the
traveler
and
100
dollars
a
day
was
a
lot
of
money
.
""
So
you
are
going
home
.
Where
do
you
come
from
?
""
He
asked
.
""
I
come
from
New
York

""
New
York
,

the
taxi
driver

,

Susan

Do
you
know
her

""
Of
course
I
know

She

me
200
dollars

"Juac
has
made
the
leap
from
being
an
African
refugee
to
a
chess
champion
in
the
United
States
.
His
job
is
to
share
his
expertise
with
students
in
schools
,
chess
camps
and
other
events
.
 
During
Sudan
's
civil
war
in
the
mid-1980s
,
Juac
was
forced
out
of
the
country
with
20,000
0ther
so
-called
Lost
Boys
.
He
fled
to
Ethiopia
,
then
to
Kenya
staying
in
a
refugee
camp
for
eight
years
,
where
he
learned
to
play
chess
.
 
Juac
described
a
dangerous
journey
in
which
half
the
boys
did
n't
survive
.
To
eat
,
they
had
to
kill
wild
animals
.
 
""
There
were
animals
on
the
way
.
It
was
about
a
thousand
miles
and
sometimes
there
was
no
water
.
When
we
were
in
Ethiopia
,
we
had
to
cross
the
river
and
there
a
lot
drowned
.
""
 
Juac
arrived
in
the
United
States
in
2004
and
began
working
as
a
security
guard
.
Winning
a
chess
tournament
gave
him
this
teaching
opportunity
.
Juac
believes
chess
helps
prepare
young
people
for
life
.
 
""
Some
kids
are
not
interested
,
so
it
's
your
job
to
make
them
like
the
game
,
to
explain
them
what
chess
is
going
to
help
them
with
.
""
He
said
.
""
Like
,
I
can
tell
,
this
game
will
give
you
patience
,
and
help
with
your
math
skills
.
""
 
Julie
Cathone
,
a
second
grade
teacher
in
Jackson
Public
School
,
agrees
.
The
School
's
principal
,
Meghan
Kelley
,
said
Juac
and
chess
have
made
a
big
difference
.
 
""
What
a
role
model
.
I
mean
when
you
think
about
just
overcoming
,
and
finding
what
you
love
and
turning
that
into
your
life
's
work
.
""
 
Juac
said
he
enjoys
the
freedom
he
has
in
the
United
States
.
But
his
passion
is
playing
and
teaching
chess
to
youngsters
.
His
boss
,
Michael
Propper
,
said
Juac
has
one
great
advantage
.
 
""
I
think
he
's
believable
.
I
think
they
look
at
him
and
he
's
so
unassuming
that
they
feel
like
they
can
do
what
he
's
doing
and
be
a
person
as
he
is
too
.
""
 
Ju
ac
still
has
a
big
goal
ahead
of
him-becoming
an
international
chess
master
.
With
his
skill
and
patience
,
Propper
and
his
peers
have
no
doubt
that
will
happen

"What
does
the
word
""
home
""
mean
to
you
?
How
do
you
say
the
word
in
French
?
In
Spanish
?
In
your
language
?
Although
people
usually
know
what
the
word
means
,
it
often
has
no
exact
translation
.
It
's
not
surprising
really
,
because
the
idea
of
home
differs
from
country
to
country
,
and
from
person
to
person
.
A
home
is
more
than
a
roof
and
four
walls
.
It
's
the
cooking
,
eating
,
talking
,
playing
and
family
living
that
go
on
inside
,
which
are
important
as
well
.
And
at
home
you
usually
feel
safe
and
relaxed
.
 
But
it
's
not
just
that
homes
look
different
in
different
countries
,
they
also
contain
different
things
and
reveal
different
attitudes
and
needs
.
For
example
,
in
cold
northern
Europe
,
there
's
a
fire
in
the
living
room
or
kitchen
and
all
the
chairs
face
it
.
In
the
south
,
where
the
sun
shines
a
lot
and
it
's
more
important
to
keep
the
heat
out
,
there
are
small
windows
,
cool
stone
floors
and
often
no
carpets
.
We
asked
some
people
about
their
homes
.
 
How
often
do
people
move
house
in
your
country
?
 
""
In
my
country
many
people
do
n't
stay
in
one
place
for
a
very
long
time
.
They
often
move
every
ten
years
or
so
.
""
 
Cheryl
,
Boston
,
USA
 
What
are
typical
features
of
homes
in
your
country
?
 
""
In
Britain
,
even
in
town
there
's
always
a
garden
and
sometimes
a
cellar
.
We
have
separate
bedrooms
and
living
rooms
.
But
we
do
n't
often
have
balconies
.
The
weather
is
n't
warm
enough
!

"It
should
be
very
clear
that
we
live
in
a
most
spectacular
time
.
It
's
a
time
when
information
is
of
primary
importance
.
It
's
a
time
when
new
information
technologies
are
fundamentally
transforming
the
world
in
every
aspect
.
Among
the
changes
,
which
have
come
upon
modern
society
,
the
ones
in
education
are
probably
the
most
obvious
and
influential
.
New
information
technologies
are
accelerating
changes
in
education
,
at
the
same
time
presenting
revolutionary
tools
with
the
potential
to
make
education
more
efficient
and
more
effective
than
ever
.
 
The
application
of
new
information
technologies
has
remarkably
promoted
the
process
of
education
.
Online
learning
is
probably
the
best
case
in
point
.
As
is
often
the
case
with
""
technology
""
,
online
learning
may
appear
to
be
horrible
;
it
can
sound
like
alphabet
soup
sometimes
.
Now
let
's
see
whether
you
can
understand
all
this
.
You
can
participate
in
CBT
at
a
CLC
via
the
convenience
of
IDL
.
What
does
it
all
mean
?
Let
me
translate
:
GBT
--
Computer-Based
Training
;
CLC
--
Computer
Learning
Center
;
IDL
--
Interactive
Distance
Learning
.
Sound
complicated
?
Not
really
.
Online
learning
is
much
less
complicated
than
it
seems
.
Students
can
learn
at
any
time
,
anywhere
,
at
any
speed
.
They
can
make
their
own
learning
schedules
and
follow
their
own
paths
to
suit
their
lifestyles
.
In
my
university
,
every
semester
there
're
several
online
courses
available
,
which
need
no
class
meetings
or
paper
materials
.
The
only
thing
I
have
to
do
is
just
to
get
online
regularly
as
I
wish
,
and
download
necessary
learning
materials
.
Then
everything
I
need
to
know
about
the
course
is
only
a
click
away
.
 
But
online
learning
is
not
perfect
;
it
's
like
the
microwave
oven
:
it
does
some
things
better
,
but
it
is
not
a
complete
replacement
for
the
traditional
model
.
The
traditional
classroom
model
for
education
and
learning
is
hard
to
leave
behind
.
Because
humans
are
social
creatures
,
there
're
times
when
we
need
to
see
each
other
face-to-face
for
interactive
learning
.
A
social
and
personal
connection
often
builds
effective
teams
,
solves
problems
,
and
inspires
confidence
.
So
one
possible
solution
is
to
combine
online
learning
with
the
old
traditional
classroom
learning
,
which
not
only
makes
the
learning
process
faster
and
cheaper
,
but
also
highlights
the
interactions
between
teachers
and
students
.
 
The
bottom
line
:
the
Internet
is
the
most
important
educational
tool
in
the
information
age
and
online
learning
will
become
a
main
part
of
every
individual
's
learning
experience
in
the
future
.
That
's
exactly
how
we
will
move
knowledge
from
the
ones
who
have
it
to
the
ones
who
need
it
faster
and
cheaper
,
and
that
's
how
we
're
going
to
survive
in
the
information
age

"My
legs
do
n't
do
much
because
I
have
a
serious
disease
.
_
just
sit
there
and
look
pretty
.
When
people
look
at
me
,
they
only
see
the
chair
--
my
wheelchair
.
I
've
been
in
one
since
I
was
3
years
old
.
And
it
does
n't
matter
if
I
graduate
at
the
top
of
my
class
and
go
to
law
school
.
To
some
,
I
'll
always
be
the
girl
in
the
chair
.
 
But
I
do
n't
think
of
myself
as
the
kid
who
ca
n't
walk
.
Most
of
my
friends
do
n't
even
notice
the
chair
anymore
.
I
'm
just
the
girl
they
've
been
friends
with
.
My
friends
are
good
at
lifting
me
in
and
out
of
my
small
car
when
we
go
to
the
movies
.
We
even
took
the
car
to
the
dance
.
One
of
the
boys
helped
me
out
of
the
car
and
all
the
girls
helped
me
to
fix
my
dress
.
Even
in
the
crowded
school
elevator
,
there
's
always
someone
around
to
carry
me
.
 
There
are
a
lot
of
things
I
ca
n't
do
for
myself
,
such
as
lifting
my
arms
,
dressing
myself
,
and
feeding
myself
.
Even
so
,
I
do
very
well
at
school
and
I
always
tell
myself
that
I
'm
just
like
any
other
kid
in
my
school
.
 
The
truth
is
that
my
parents
raised
me
to
be
proud
of
my
disability
.
There
are
plenty
of
things
I
wish
I
could
do
differently
.
I
wanted
to
be
a
doctor
.
But
that
's
not
going
to
work
out
.
So
I
'll
be
a
lawyer
instead
.
I
also
wanted
to
dance
and
play
soccer
.
My
parents
taught
me
that
I
'm
like
this
for
a
reason
--
to
educate
people
and
show
them
that
this
disease
affects
my
bones
--
not
my
brain
.
My
friends
Erica
once
said
to
me
,
""
Kennedy
,
you
're
not
disabled
.
You
just
ca
n't
walk
.

"When
you
were
a
child
you
had
a
pure
mind
which
was
free
from
worries
and
anxieties
.
However
,
as
time
goes
by
,
you
're
faced
with
so
many
problems
in
life
.
Below
are
five
techniques
that
can
help
you
get
relaxed
.
 
1
.
Mind
your
own
business
.
 
Yes
,
please
mind
your
own
business
.
When
you
start
being
concerned
about
things
which
are
not
related
to
you
,
you
lose
your
control
on
your
thought
process
,
which
often
has
negative
results
disturbing
the
mental
peace
.
Basically
,
your
mind
starts
wandering
here
and
there
.
So
next
time
an
unnecessary
thought
comes
to
your
mind
,
think
whether
this
is
really
something
you
should
be
worrying
for
?
If
not
,
keep
it
away
and
focus
on
something
positive
,
practical
and
fruitful
.
 
2
.
Surround
yourself
with
positive
people
.
 
Ignore
negative
comments
and
stay
away
from
negative
souls
.
When
someone
is
negative
,
he
spreads
negativity
and
you
get
affected
.
Staying
with
such
people
will
have
long
term
influence
on
your
character
so
think
about
your
company
.
 
3
.
Do
n't
think
about
others
too
much
.
 
Remember
:
the
great
quote
:
small
minds
discuss
people
;
Average
minds
discuss
events
;
Higher
minds
discuss
ideas
and
Great
minds
act
in
silence
.
Do
n't
allow
your
brain
to
compare
yourself
to
others
as
this
is
an
insult
to
yourself
.
Do
n't
be
jealous
;
it
's
a
heart
killing
disease
,
get
rid
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
When
you
are
jealous
you
focus
on
finding
faults
in
others
even
if
they
do
n't
have
.
This
poisons
your
soul
and
steals
the
mental
peace
.
 
4
.
You
ca
n't
keep
everyone
happy
.
 
Do
n't
be
oversensitive
.
Be
natural
in
what
you
do
.
Be
positive
and
constructive
in
your
deeds
and
then
do
n't
really
care
too
much
about
others
.
Be
aware
,
do
n't
apply
this
to
too
closed
relations
.
Develop
trust
to
build
up
powerful
relationships
.
 
5
.
Do
n't
believe
yourself
to
be
unlucky
.
 
Remember
this
:
Bad
luck
happens
to
everyone
.
It
's
not
your
fault
at
all
.
Time
,
whether
good
or
bad
,
passes
quickly
.
Develop
the
power
of
not
looking
back
into
your
past
.
Believe
in
the
power
of
Now
.
Believe
in
your
skills
.
Work
hard
and
you
will
get
what
you
have
been
entitled
for
.
Be
patient
and
see
what
has
been
planned
for
you
.
 
With
these
recommendations
,
I
believe
if
you
can
make
it
,
it
's
probable
that
you
can
bring
changes
in
your
lifestyle
and
get
back
your
mental
peace

"Since
we
are
social
beings
,
the
quality
of
our
lives
depends
in
large
measure
on
our
interpersonal
relationships
.
One
strength
of
the
human
condition
is
our
tendency
to
give
and
receive
support
from
one
another
under
stressful
circumstances
.
Social
support
consists
of
the
exchange
of
resources
among
people
based
on
their
interpersonal
ties
.
Those
of
us
with
strong
support
systems
appear
better
able
to
deal
with
major
life
changes
and
daily
difficulties
.
People
with
strong
social
ties
live
longer
and
have
better
health
than
those
without
such
ties
.
Studies
over
a
range
of
illnesses
,
from
depression
to
heart
disease
,
show
that
the
presence
of
social
support
helps
people
protect
themselves
from
illness
,
and
the
absence
of
such
support
makes
poor
health
more
likely
.
 
Social
support
cushions
stress
in
a
number
of
ways
.
First
,
friends
,
relatives
and
coworkers
may
let
us
know
that
they
value
us
.
Our
self
respect
is
strengthened
when
we
feel
accepted
by
others
despite
our
faults
and
difficulties
.
Second
,
other
people
often
provide
us
with
informational
support
.
They
help
us
to
explain
and
understand
our
problems
and
find
solutions
to
them
.
Third
,
we
typically
find
social
companionship
supportive
.
Engaging
in
leisure
time
activities
with
others
helps
us
to
meet
our
social
needs
while
at
the
same
time
distract
(
...
)
us
from
our
worries
and
troubles
.
Finally
,
other
people
may
give
us
important
support
--
financial
aid
,
material
resources
,
and
needed
services
--
that
reduces
stress
by
helping
us
solve
and
deal
with
our
problems

"It
's
the
second
time
for
me
to
come
to
Beijing
.
There
are
many
places
of
interest
in
Beijing
,
such
as
the
Summer
Palace
,
the
Great
Wall
,
etc
.
What
's
more
,
I
think
great
changes
have
taken
place
in
Beijing
.
People
's
living
conditions
have
improved
a
lot
.
Their
life
is
very
happy
.
Almost
everyone
has
a
big
smile
on
the
face
.
People
in
Beijing
are
in
high
spirits
and
hard-working
.
Children
can
receive
a
good
education
.
 
But
in
the
past
,
some
children
did
n't
have
enough
money
to
go
to
school
.
They
often
worked
for
cruel
bosses
.
The
bosses
did
n't
give
them
enough
food
.
I
feel
sorry
for
them
.
Today
people
have
already
lived
in
tall
building
,
worn
beautiful
clothes
and
so
on
.
Life
has
changed
greatly

"Although
men
and
women
have
been
growing
crops
for
thousands
of
years
,
they
have
not
always
had
enough
to
eat
.
Even
today
,
many
people
in
the
world
go
hungry
,
and
even
die
of
hunger
.
If
we
are
to
grow
enough
for
everybody
,
we
have
to
grow
more
crops
and
better
crops
.
 
Plants
need
the
right
food
in
order
to
grow
.
In
particular
,
they
need
three
chemical
substances
in
the
soil
:
nitrogen
,
phosphorus
and
potassium
.
They
also
need
smaller
amounts
of
other
chemical
substances
like
calcium
.
If
there
is
too
little
of
any
of
these
substances
in
the
soil
,
plants
ca
n't
grow
well
.
 
When
a
plant
grows
,
it
takes
up
these
basic
substances
from
the
soil
and
builds
them
into
itself
.
If
we
remove
the
plant
from
the
soil
and
use
it
for
food
,
we
are
taking
some
of
these
substances
away
,
and
this
means
that
future
plants
will
find
less
of
them
in
the
soil
.
In
time
,
the
soil
would
become
too
poor
for
plants
to
grow
in
it
at
all
.
 
To
prevent
this
we
must
put
basic
substances
back
.
One
way
of
doing
this
is
putting
manure
on
the
soil
.
This
contains
the
remains
of
plants
that
have
been
eaten
,
and
,
if
we
add
it
to
the
soil
,
we
are
returning
some
of
the
basic
substances
.
In
Europe
and
in
prefix
=
st1
/Japan
,
manure
from
animals
has
for
long
been
used
in
this
way
.
Unfortunately
much
of
the
animal
waste
inIndiais
used
as
fuel
because
there
is
not
enough
wood
to
burn
.
This
means
there
is
less
manure
for
the
crops
.
 
Even
when
we
use
manure
,
we
can
not
put
back
into
the
soil
more
of
the
basic
substances
than
have
been
taken
out
.
Often
the
soil
does
not
have
enough
of
them
in
the
first
place
,
and
so
we
must
provide
extra
supplies
.
We
can
use
chemical
fertilizers
.
Experiments
in
Indiahave
shown
that
,
if
we
use
a
fertilizer
containing
a
mixture
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
,
we
get
half
as
much
rice
again
from
the
crops
on
any
one
piece
of
land

"On
February
9
th,2013
,
Sarah
Darling
was
walking
along
the
street
when
she
met
a
homeless
man
named
Billy
Ray
Harris
.
She
reached
into
her
change
purse
,
emptied
out
all
the
coins
she
had
and
gave
them
to
the
homeless
man
.
Neither
of
them
realized
that
this
small
generous
act
would
change
their
lives
.
 
Sarah
did
n't
realize
that
she
had
given
Billy
not
only
all
her
change
but
also
her
diamond
ring
that
she
had
put
in
her
change
purse
earlier
until
the
following
morning
.
She
and
her
husband
,
Bill
Krejci
,
rushed
to
see
if
they
could
find
Billy
.
The
homeless
man
was
not
only
in
the
same
place
,
he
also
immediately
returned
the
ring
.
The
grateful
couple
paid
him
back
for
his
honesty
by
emptying
out
their
pockets
of
all
the
money
they
had
.
 
Bill
Krejci
,
a
web
designer
,
felt
that
he
needed
to
do
something
more
for
this
amazingly
 
honest
man
.
So
on
February
18th
,
he
set
up
a
special
page
to
raise
money
for
him
.
In
just
four
days
,
Billy
received
over
$
85,000
and
there
seems
to
be
no
end
yet
.
 
That
is
not
enough
.
Billy
is
1iving
with
a
person
who
is
generous
instead
of
living
in
the
streets
.
And
that
's
not
all
--
thanks
to
the
news
report
,
he
got
together
again
with
his
older
brother
,
Edwin
Harris
who
he
had
been
unable
to
find
for
27
years
.
 
All
the
good
luck
is
just
because
Billy
did
the
right
thing
--
returning
something
that
did
not
belong
to
him

"The
small
coastal
town
of
Broome
,
in
northwest
Australia
,
is
a
remote
village
in
the
vast
countryside
.
 
There
are
no
traffic
jams
and
hardly
any
roads
.
There
is
only
the
massive
Australian
wild
land
,
where
some
houses
are
500
miles
apart
and
some
driveways
are
50
miles
long
.
 
There
seem
to
be
only
two
main
sources
of
entertainment
out
here
:
the
sunset
at
the
beach
and
Sun
Pictures
.
 
Sun
Pictures
is
a
very
different
movie
theater
:
The
seats
are
park
benches
and
deck
chairs
,
but
you
're
also
welcome
to
sit
on
the
grass
.
 
It
is
the
world
's
oldest
outdoor
movie
garden
.
Sun
Pictures
was
built
in
1916
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
from
Hollywood
.
All
the
big
films
were
shipped
here
and
the
lonely
country
was
amazed
.
 
Broome
resident
Pearl
Hamaguchi
has
never
traveled
far
from
home
.
But
in
the
Sun
Pictures
chairs
,
under
the
deep
blue
night
sky
,
she
has
been
almost
everywhere
.
 
""
And
we
came
back
excited
about
Gregory
Peck
,
""
she
recalled
.
 
This
is
one
of
the
few
places
left
in
the
world
where
you
can
see
two
sets
of
stars
at
the
same
time
--
--
-one
set
in
the
sky
,
the
other
in
the
film
.
 
Each
night
,
dozens
of
people
from
around
the
world
line
up
at
the
old
wooden
stand
,
with
no
computer
in
sight
,
and
buy
their
tickets
to
the
latest
films
.
 
Sun
Pictures
is
also
a
museum
,
exhibiting
projectors
that
date
back
to
the
silent
films
,
a
portrait
gallery
of
the
famous
people
who
never
knew
about
this
place
--
--
even
though
they
came
here
all
the
time
.
 
Every
once
in
a
while
,
I
'm
told
,
you
might
find
a
non-ticket
holder
in
your
seat
.
That
's
why
it
's
always
a
good
idea
to
shake
out
your
chair
to
make
sure
there
are
no
spiders
or
scorpions
.
 
""
We
've
only
had
a
couple
of
scorpion
incidents
but
no
one
's
been
stung
yet
,
""
said
Aaron
Mestemaker
,
a
tourist
visiting
from
Michigan
.
 
Sun
Pictures
is
a
holy
hall
of
movie
history
and
a
reminder
that
air
conditioning
and
carpet
are
no
match
for
grass
and
fresh
air
--
-even
when
the
lizards
steal
the
scene

"If
you
're
like
most
teens
,
you
probably
spend
a
lot
of
time
online
.
The
Internet
is
a
great
place
to
do
homework
,
talk
to
your
friends
and
download
your
favorite
music
.
But
with
all
of
that
good
stuff
,
there
is
also
bad
stuff
.
So
we
've
put
together
some
safety
tips
for
you
.
 
Some
people
pretend
to
be
your
age
or
a
friendly
adult
so
that
you
will
trust
them
.
You
can
never
be
certain
that
people
you
meet
on
the
Internet
are
really
who
they
say
they
are
.
It
's
dangerous
to
get
together
with
someone
you
met
online
.
We
suggest
that
you
never
do
it
.
As
we
said
before
,
they
may
not
be
who
they
say
they
are
.
However
,
if
your
parents
agree
to
the
meeting
,
they
should
go
with
you
,
and
the
meeting
should
be
in
a
public
place
.
 
When
you
are
online
,
never
give
anyone
personal
information
like
your
name
,
address
,
phone
number
,
the
name
or
location
of
your
school
or
your
parents
'
names
or
where
they
work
.
Do
n't
put
personal
information
or
your
picture
in
your
online
profile
or
anywhere
else
online
.
Use
a
screen
name
that
is
different
from
your
real
name
and
your
e-mail
address
.
 
Stay
out
of
chat
rooms
.
Some
people
in
chat
rooms
often
create
a
fake
profile
,
hoping
a
teen
will
trust
them
.
Someone
who
seems
to
be
a
14-year-old
girl
from
New
York
who
wants
to
be
friends
may
be
a
42-year-old
man
from
California
who
wants
something
else

"Lin
Tao
and
Chen
Hai
are
good
friends
.
They
are
in
the
same
class
.
They
are
in
the
same
team
.
Lin
Tao
sits
behind
Chen
Hai
.
Now
it
is
four
o'clock
.
School
is
over
.
They
often
go
to
play
games
after
school
.
They
ca
n't
look
after
their
things
very
well
.
So
their
mothers
do
n't
give
them
watches
.
They
do
n't
have
watches
.
They
do
n't
know
the
time
.
But
they
can
ask
a
man
under
the
big
tree
.
His
watch
is
very
nice
.
They
can
also
see
the
clock
on
the
wall
of
the
classroom
.
Now
it
's
about
five
in
the
afternoon
.
It
's
time
to
go
home
.
They
must
put
on
their
clothes
and
go
home

"Language
changes
all
the
time
.
The
words
used
by
young
people
in
the
UK
can
be
very
different
to
those
used
by
adults
.
These
extremely
informal
words
and
expressions
are
known
as
""
slang
""
.
Here
are
a
few
examples
:
 
*Instead
of
using
different
tag
question
like
is
n't
it
?
Ca
n't
you
or
do
n't
they
?
People
use
""
innit
""
.e.g
.
It
's
hot
here
,
is
n't
it
?
=
""
It
's
""
hot
here
,
innit
!
 
*Instead
of
saying
very
,
really
or
completely
,
they
use
""
well
""
.
e.g
.
I
'm
well
tired
.
 
*
""
Whatever
""
means
""
I
do
n't
care
""
.
e.g
.
A
:
But
the
teacher
says
we
ca
n't
leave
until
we
've
finished
.
B
:
Whatever
.
I
'm
going
.
 
Nobody
uses
slang
and
not
everybody
likes
it
.
A
school
in
Sheffield
,
in
the
north
of
England
,
recently
instructed
its
pupils
to
stop
using
slang
words
.
The
head
teacher
says
that
if
young
people
learn
to
speak
'correctly
'
this
will
help
them
get
a
good
job
.
 
When
British
people
use
slang
,
it
's
no
surprise
that
some
students
say
they
ca
n't
understand
native
speakers
.
But
perhaps
learners
do
n't
need
to
worry
about
communicating
with
native
speakers
so
much
.
Research
shows
that
most
of
the
English
spoken
in
the
world
today
is
spoken
between
non-native
speakers
of
the
language
.
In
fact
,
when
we
think
about
""
International
English
""
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
native
or
non-native
speaker
.
 
How
important
is
it
to
understand
these
slang
words
and
expressions
?
If
you
watch
films
or
TV
,
chat
online
in
English
,
then
understanding
slang
can
be
very
useful
.
But
you
probably
wo
n't
see
much
slang
in
your
English
exam
though
.
With
over
seven
billion
people
living
on
our
planet
today
,
it
's
easy
to
think
one
person
's
actions
wo
n't
make
a
difference
,
however
,
from
personal
experience
,
I
can
say
:
each
of
us
is
capable
of
making
a
difference
,
however
small
,
to
someone
's
life

"If
you
're
among
the
millions
of
Americans
packing
their
vacation
bags
for
summer
trips
,
do
n't
forget
,
however
,
that
as
soon
as
you
step
off
the
plane
,
you
're
expected
to
follow
that
country
's
laws
.
We
took
a
look
at
one
of
the
top
countries
Americans
are
most
likely
to
visit
and
what
might
happen
if
you
got
caught
.
 
prefix
=

/Mexico
 
Smoking
marijuana
:
If
police
find
you
smoking
a
cigarette
which
contains
marijuana
,
they
will
most
likely
detain
you
overnight
and
you
will
get
a
fine
.
 
Carrying
a
firearm
:
You
might
be
able
to
walk
around
with
a
gun
in
Texas
,
but
that
is
n't
so
in
Mexico
,
so
leave
your
gun
behind
.
If
you
wish
to
go
hunting
in
Mexico.you
can
apply
for
a
gun
permit
but
expect
to
be
charged
$
5,000.If
you
are
caught
bringing
a
firearm
,
Mexican
policeman
may
take
away
your
car
and
arrest
you
.
An
arrested
American
may
spend
months
in
prison
while
his
or
her
case
is
being
looked
into
.
 
Driving
70
mph
on
the
highway
:
Speed
limits
are
on
the
lower
side
.
Depending
on
what
type
of
highway
you
're
driving
on
,
you
should
n't
go
faster
than
62
mph
.
The
police
enforce
the
speed
limit
,
but
most
local
police
do
n't
have
radars
.
The
maximum
fine
for
speeding
is
about
$
40
.
To
scare
tourists
into
paying
the
fine
""
on
the
spot
""
,
sometimes
police
will
threaten
to
keep
your
driver
's
license
.
This
is
illegal
,
so
call
them
on
it

"Almost
all
people
like
flowers
.
Some
people
like
flowers
because
of
their
smells
,
shapes
,
colors
and
so
on
.
Others
like
flowers
because
they
think
different
flowers
mean
different
things
.
Flowers
have
their
own
language
.
For
example
,
red
roses
mean
""
love
""
and
sunflowers
mean
""
loyalty
""
.
So
people
in
more
than
100
countries
have
chosen
their
own
national
flowers
which
say
something
about
their
countries
'
spirit
.
In
1994
,
China
talked
about
choosing
a
national
flower
.
Some
people
liked
the
peony
but
others
liked
the
plum
blossom
.
They
could
n't
agree
with
each
other
.
So
it
has
not
been
decided
yet
.
 
People
like
to
buy
different
flowers
in
different
seasons
.
Where
do
all
the
beautiful
flowers
in
shops
come
from
?
They
may
come
from
far
away
,
so
their
price
is
higher
.
 
a
.
Farmers
grow
flowers
in
their
fields
.
 
b
.
Planes
or
trains
or
buses
take
the
flowers
to
different
places
.
 
c.
Flower
shopkeepers
buy
flowers
from
the
flower
markets
.
They
look
after
the
flowers
and
throw
away
the
broken
or
bad
ones
.
They
cut
the
flowers
to
make
them
more
beautiful
.
 
d.
You
go
to
buy
the
flowers
in
the
shops
.
When
you
buy
a
flower
,
you
're
paying
lots
of
people
:
the
farmer
,
the
driver
of
the
plane
or
train
or
bus
,
the
seller
in
the
flower
market
and
the
flower
shopkeeper
.
 
So
you
'd
better
keep
your
flowers
from
far
away
for
a
long
time
.
But
how
?
Why
not
dry
them
?
It
's
easy
!
Sand
drying
is
a
way
.
Dry
,
clean
sand
is
one
of
the
oldest
things
for
drying
flowers
.
And
it
's
one
of
the
cheapest
.
 
*Fill
a
box
half-way
with
sand
.
 
*Put
the
flowers
on
top
of
the
sand
.
 
*Put
the
box
in
a
warm
,
dry
place
.
 
*Leave
the
flowers
there
for
one
to
three
weeks
.
 
*Take
them
out
and
they
will
be
dry

"Saying
no
starts
small
 
'All
right
then-just
one
more
piece
...
'
Words
every
girl
has
said
when
they
are
faced
with
the
delicious
cheesecake
.
Of
course
,
many
of
us
know
we
may
eat
the
whole
thing
in
the
end
.
 
It
is
n't
just
girls
.
Most
of
us
find
it
hard
to
say
'no
'
to
something
attractive
,
However
,
scientists
now
say
that
willpower
is
very
important
to
success
and
a
happy
life
.
 
Scientists
in
different
countries
have
been
studying
the
effects
of
willpower
on
people
's
lives
for
a
long
time
.
The
results
are
similar
,
according
to
an
article
on
February
7
in
the
Guardian
,
a
famous
British
newspaper
.
 
In
one
experiment
,
scientists
told
young
children
that
they
could
either
have
a
marshmallow
now
,
or
two
marshmallows
in
15
minutes
.
Waiting
obviously
needed
more
willpower
.
Scientists
then
continued
studying
the
children
as
they
grew
up
.
They
wanted
to
see
if
some
children
always
had
stronger
willpower
.
They
also
wanted
to
see
how
having
stronger
willpower
affected
their
lives
.
 
Years
later
,
scientists
found
that
the
children
who
had
waited
for
two
marshmallows
were
all
healthier
,
happier
and
richer
adults
.
Oppositely
,
the
children
who
had
shown
weaker
willpower
at
that
young
age
were
more
likely
to
be
in
low-paid
jobs
,
to
be
overweight
,
to
have
social
problems
.
 
But
there
is
hope
,
Roy
F
Baumeister
,
an
American
social
psychology
professor
told
the
Guardian
.
Baumeister
says
we
can
train
our
willpower
just
like
we
train
our
muscles
.
Even
a
little
practice
can
strengthen
our
overall
self-control
if
we
do
it
regularly
.
 
You
could
start
by
making
yourself
stand
up
straight
,
speaking
in
complete
sentences
,
or
using
a
computer
mouse
with
the
other
hand
.
Scientists
have
found
that
people
who
manage
to
change
little
habits
often
perform
much
better
in
laboratory
willpower
tests
.
 
Like
muscles
,
willpower
can
'get
tired
'
.
Do
n't
try
to
do
too
many
things
at
the
same
time
,
or
when
you
do
n't
have
enough
energy
,
for
example
when
you
are
ill
.
If
you
already
feel
tired
,
you
can
try
to
recharge
your
willpower
with
a
good
night
's
sleep
and
by
eating
well

"Sometimes
,
even
the
best
friends
have
fights
.
They
disagree
with
each
other
and
begin
to
argue
.
Sometimes
,
they
even
stop
talking
to
each
other
.
What
can
be
done
to
help
the
two
friends
make
up
?
Finding
a
good
friend
who
knows
both
of
them
very
well
to
be
a
peacemaker
is
a
good
way
.
Maybe
one
day
you
will
be
a
peacemaker
for
your
good
friends
.
Here
are
some
useful
communication
strategies
for
you
to
use
.
 
State
your
feelings
clearly
but
do
n't
criticize
them
.
Begin
with
""
I
feel
""
instead
of
""
You
always
...
""
.
 
Do
n't
stop
or
finish
the
other
person
's
sentences
.
 
Listen
carefully
to
what
the
other
person
is
saying
.
Try
to
see
the
other
person
's
side
of
the
disagreement
.
 
Look
the
other
person
in
the
eyes
when
you
are
talking
.
 
Ask
questions
to
make
sure
that
you
understand
them
.
 
Repeat
the
other
person
's
ideas
as
you
understand
them
.
 
Never
put
anyone
down
.
Saying
things
like
""
You
're
stupid
""
makes
communication
difficult
.
 
Try
to
find
a
solution
that
makes
the
two
friends
happy
.
Never
decide
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong
.
Instead
,
help
them
to
find
their
own
""
win-win
""
solution
.
A
""
win-win
""
solution
allows
each
of
them
to
feel
good
.
In
this
way
,
their
friendship
can
be
continued

"I
recall
a
moment
that
I
experienced
with
my
dad
when
I
was
twenty-one
.
I
was
going
to
college
and
living
with
a
couple
of
friends
in
Chicago
.
 
When
the
car
I
was
using
died
,
my
dad
,
realizing
that
I
needed
transportation
to
get
to
work
and
to
school
,
was
good
enough
to
lend
me
the
money
for
a
used
car
.
Shortly
after
I
bought
it
,
my
parents
drove
down
to
San
Diego
for
the
winter
.
Before
they
left
,
my
dad
gave
me
some
of
his
bank
deposit
slips
with
clear
and
detailed
instructions
to
put
one
hundred
dollars
of
my
earnings
,
every
payday
,
into
their
savings
account
while
they
were
gone
.
 
At
that
time
of
my
life
,
I
was
not
yet
clear
about
what
were
the
most
important
problems
that
I
had
to
attend
to
first
.
I
dismissed
our
agreement
as
nothing
important
and
continued
to
spend
my
money
as
fast
as
I
was
making
it
,
in
pubs
,
on
dates
,
and
so
on
.
Instead
of
honoring
our
agreement
,
I
made
payments
that
were
less
than
the
agreed-upon
amounts
,
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
I
made
no
payment
at
all
.
 
When
my
parents
arrived
home
in
late
March
,
I
got
a
call
from
my
dad
,
who
said
,
""
Do
n't
go
anywhere
.
I
'm
coming
over
.
""
My
dad
was
(
and
still
is
)
a
physical
presence
and
had
been
a
truck
driver
for
thirty-five
years
.
I
felt
ashamed
and
guilty
,
knowing
that
Dad
had
discovered
that
I
had
n't
held
up
my
end
of
our
bargain
.
 
After
he
came
in
,
he
told
me
to
sit
down
because
he
had
a
few
things
to
tell
me
.
There
was
no
shouting
,
no
red
face
with
a
vein
about
to
burst
on
his
forehead
,
and
no
bad
language
at
all
.
His
first
words
were
,
""
When
your
mother
and
I
got
back
into
town
yesterday
,
I
called
the
bank
.
I
ca
n't
say
I
was
surprised
to
discover
that
you
had
n't
made
all
the
payments
.
My
first
thought
was
to
come
here
and
take
the
car
from
you
,
but
I
want
to
tell
you
some
things
while
I
'm
here
.
Maybe
you
'll
understand
,
and
maybe
you
wo
n't
.
""
 
He
went
on
to
tell
me
,
very
calmly
,
about
what
it
means
to
keep
your
word
.
He
explained
that
when
he
was
growing
up
after
the
Depression
,
a
man
's
handshake
and
his
word
meant
everything
.
He
also
told
me
that
because
I
was
twenty-one
,
he
did
n't
feel
angry
so
much
as
sad
and
disappointed
.
He
closed
by
saying
that
our
words
and
actions
have
a
real
effect
on
others
,
and
that
my
words
and
actions
were
what
others
would
measure
me
by
.
He
added
that
if
I
had
n't
yet
formed
some
core
or
basic
values
and
principles
,
this
might
be
a
good
time
to
start
thinking
about
those
things
.
 
For
the
first
time
,
I
saw
real
disappointment
on
Dad
's
face
.
 
He
gave
me
a
second
chance
to
make
our
deal
right
,
and
even
gave
me
more
deposit
slips
,
saying
,
""
I
will
take
those
keys
if
you
miss
a
single
payment
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
if
you
do
n't
let
me
know

He
spoke
for
about
forty-five
minutes
,
and
I
listened
.
He
did
n't
expect
me
to
say
much
,
and
I
knew
enough
to
keep
quiet
.
I
just
nodded
or
shook
my
head
at
the
right
time
and
continued
to
listen
.
 
That
time
we
spent
together
changed
me
forever
.
Then
and
there
,
I
made
a
promise
to
myself
that
I
'd
never
again
be
the
cause
of
that
look
of
sadness
and
disappointment
on
Dad
's
face
.
After
that
defining
afternoon
,
our
relationship
got
better
and
better
.
I
'm
now
married
with
two
sons
of
my
own
,
and
they
're
already
learning
about
the
importance
of
honor
,
trust
,
and
honesty

"I
was
now
in
my
twenty
third
year
of
residence
in
this
island
and
was
accustomed
to
the
place
and
to
the
manner
of
living
.
If
it
had
not
been
the
savages
who
had
come
to
the
place
to
disturb
me
,
I
could
have
been
content
to
spent
the
rest
of
my
time
there
,
even
to
the
last
moment
,
till
I
had
laid
me
down
and
died
,
like
the
old
goat
in
the
cave
.
 
I
had
also
arrived
to
some
little
recreations
and
amusements
,
which
made
the
time
pass
more
pleasantly
with
me
a
great
deal
than
it
did
before
.
 
At
first
,
I
had
taught
my
Poll
to
speak
.
And
he
did
it
so
familiarly
and
talked
so
clearly
and
plain
that
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
.
And
he
lived
with
me
no
less
than
twenty
six
years
.
How
long
he
might
live
afterwards
,
I
do
n't
know
;
though
I
know
they
have
an
idea
in
Brazil
that
they
live
a
hundred
years
.
Perhaps
poor
Poll
may
be
alive
there
still
,
calling
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
to
this
day
.
I
wish
no
other
English
man
had
the
bad
luck
to
go
there
and
hear
him
.
But
if
he
did
,
he
would
certainly
believe
it
was
the
devil
.
 
My
dog
was
a
very
pleasant
and
loving
companion
to
me
,
for
no
less
than
sixteen
years
of
my
time
,
and
then
died
of
mere
old
age
.
 
As
for
my
cats
,
they
multiplied
to
that
degree
that
I
had
to
shoot
several
of
them
at
first
to
keep
them
from
eating
up
all
I
had
.
 
Besides
these
,
I
had
two
more
parrots
which
talked
pretty
well
and
would
all
call
Robin
Crusoe
,
but
none
like
my
first
.
Nor
indeed
did
I
take
the
pains
with
any
of
them
that
I
had
done
with
him
.
 
I
had
also
several
sea-fowls
,
whose
names
I
do
n't
know
,
that
I
caught
upon
the
shore
and
cut
their
wings
.
And
the
little
stakes
which
I
had
planted
before
my
castle
wall
being
now
grown
up
to
a
good
thick
bush
,
these
fowls
all
lived
among
these
low
trees
and
bred
there
,
which
was
very
agreeable
to
me
;
so
that
as
I
said
above
,
I
began
to
be
well
content
with
the
life
I
led
if
not
worried
about
the
threat
from
the
savages

"More
than
half
of
rich
Americans
have
not
shown
their
full
wealth
to
their
children
,
a
new
survey
showed
last
Tuesday
.
 
The
survey
,
published
by
the
Bank
of
America
,
studied
the
rich
with
$
3
million
or
more
in
possessions
.
It
found
that
""
surprisingly
few
of
those
surveyed
have
well-developed
plans
to
preserve
and
pass
on
their
possessions
to
their
children
""
.
 
The
majority
of
the
457
people
surveyed
are
self-made
,
first-generation
rich
.
Fifty-two
percent
of
parents
have
not
chosen
not
to
tell
their
children
just
how
wealthy
they
are
,
and
15
percent
have
given
away
nothing
about
the
family
wealth
.
One
in
three
parents
said
they
had
never
thought
to
do
it
.
 
They
are
worried
that
their
children
would
become
lazy
,
spend
money
freely
,
make
bad
decisions
and
even
become
a
target
for
attractive
women
who
use
their
looks
to
get
money
from
rich
men
.
 
Only
34
percent
strongly
agreed
that
their
children
would
be
able
to
handle
any
inheritance
they
plan
to
leave
them
.
 
""
There
is
an
expectation
about
the
wealthy
parents
that
they
have
a
responsibility
to
pass
down
their
fortune
to
the
next
generation
,
""
said
Sallie
Krawcheck
,
president
of
the
Global
Wealth
and
Investment
Management
of
the
Bank
of
America
.
""
Our
research
,
however
,
uncovered
changing
views
of
what
one
generation
owes
the
next
.
""
 
The
trend
is
led
by
the
world
's
richest
man
Bill
Gates
,
who
promised
in
2008
that
he
would
leave
his
$
58
billion
fortune
to
the
charity
started
by
him
and
his
wife
,
the
Bill
and
Melinda
Gates
Foundation
,
and
not
to
his
children
.
 
""
We
want
to
give
it
back
to
society
in
the
way
that
it
will
have
the
most
positive
effect
,
""
he
said
.
 
Of
his
plans
for
his
children
,
Gates
said
:
""
I
will
give
the
kids
some
money
but
not
a
meaningful
percentage
...
they
will
need
to
work
but
they
will
feel
reasonably
taken
care
of
.

"My
brother
,
Michael
,
was
born
one
month
before
his
due
date
and
he
also
had
cerebral
palsy
.
He
was
retarded
.
He
never
lost
his
baby
teeth
,
never
grew
taller
than
about
30
inches
and
never
weighed
more
than
28
pounds
.
They
did
estimate
,
however
,
that
he
would
not
live
to
see
his
12th
birthday
.
 
As
a
boy
I
learned
to
feed
and
clothe
Mike
.
As
a
teenager
,
I
babysat
for
my
""
big
brother
""
and
learned
use
the
proper
medicine
to
prevent
the
seizures
that
caused
him
to
tremble
.
 
Many
people
said
he
would
never
walk
or
talk
.
He
never
did
learn
to
walk
,
but
he
did
learn
to
talk
--
not
even
in
complete
sentences
,
but
he
had
the
basics
down
.
If
he
was
hungry
,
thirsty
,
happy
or
sad
,
we
knew
.
He
knew
names
too
.
I
was
Kagun
,
not
Kevin
.
But
that
changed
with
a
beard
I
grew
during
the
summer
before
college
.
Family
members
said
it
was
ugly
.
Mike
heard
it
.
 
""
Look
who
's
at
home
.
Who
's
that
?
""
they
'd
say
to
Mike
.
""
Ugly
,
""
he
would
respond
with
delight
.
 
All
of
which
--
to
me
--
was
normal
,
for
he
was
the
only
brother
I
knew
.
The
only
time
I
thought
of
the
differences
between
us
was
when
others
pointed
them
out
.
 
My
circle
of
friends
widened
when
I
entered
high
school
.
One
day
Mom
asked
if
my
new
friends
would
have
a
problem
seeing
Mike
for
the
first
time
.
""
If
they
do
n't
accept
Mike
,
they
do
n't
accept
me
and
they
are
n't
welcome
,
""
I
said
.
 
And
if
I
did
n't
think
of
him
as
different
,
I
never
thought
about
him
dying
either
.
On
a
warm
fall
night
in
1998
,
Mike
had
a
seizure
.
With
this
first
seizure
,
Mike
's
life
was
beginning
to
fade
.
 
On
March
15
,
1999
,
Mike
died
.
Michael
Patrick
Harter
--
just
26
years
old
--
died
in
Mom
's
arms
.
 
We
never
had
those
great
talks
other
brothers
have
about
women
,
work
and
parents
.
We
never
played
catch
or
talked
about
our
dreams
.
But
Mike
taught
me
compassion
and
strength
.
He
taught
me
respect
for
those
less
fortunate
than
myself
.
And
he
taught
me
an
appreciation
of
the
beauty
in
the
simplest
things
.
 
Physically
and
mentally
,
I
was
my
brother
's
keeper
.
Spiritually
,
Mike
was
and
is
my
keeper
--
a
nearly
silent
guardian
angel

"Some
British
and
American
people
like
to
invite
friends
for
a
meal
at
home
.
You
should
not
be
upset
if
your
English
friends
do
n't
invite
you
home
.
It
does
n't
mean
they
do
n't
like
you
.
Dinner
parties
usually
start
between
7
and
8
p.m.
and
end
at
about
11
.
Ask
your
hosts
what
time
you
should
arrive
.
It
's
polite
to
bring
flowers
,
chocolates
or
a
bottle
of
wine
as
a
gift
.
Usually
the
evening
starts
with
drinks
and
snacks
.
If
you
want
to
be
extra
polite
,
say
how
much
you
like
the
room
,
or
the
pictures
on
the
wall
.
But
remember-it
's
not
polite
to
ask
how
much
things
cost
.
In
many
families
,
the
husband
sits
at
one
of
the
table
and
the
wife
sits
at
the
other
end
.
They
eat
with
their
guests
.
You
'll
probably
start
the
meal
with
soup
or
something
small
,
then
you
'll
have
meat
or
fish
with
vegetables
,
and
then
dessert
,
followed
by
coffee
.
It
's
polite
to
finish
everything
on
your
plate
and
to
take
more
if
you
want
it
.
Did
you
enjoy
the
evening
?
Call
your

"Healthy
relationships
are
fun
and
make
you
feel
good
about
yourself
.
The
relationships
that
you
make
in
your
teenage
years
will
be
a
special
pan
of
your
life
.
They
will
teach
you
some
of
the
most
important
lessons
about
who
you
are
.
This
may
help
you
understand
different
kinds
of
relationships
,
what
makes
each
relationship
special
,
and
how
to
communicate
in
a
positive
way
.
 
What
makes
a
relationship
healthy
?
 
Communication
and
Sharing
:
The
most
important
part
of
any
healthy
relationship
between
two
people
is
being
able
to
talk
and
listen
to
each
other
.
You
and
the
other
person
can
find
out
what
your
common
interests
are
.
You
can
share
your
feelings
with
the
other
person
and
trust
that
he
or
she
will
be
there
to
listen
to
you
and
support
you
.
In
healthy
relationships
,
people
do
n't
lie
.
Communication
is
based
on
honesty
and
trust
.
By
listening
carefully
and
sharing
your
thoughts
and
feelings
with
other
people
,
you
show
them
that
they
play
an
important
part
in
your
life
.
 
Respect
and
Trust
:
In
healthy
relationships
,
you
learn
to
respect
and
trust
important
people
in
your
life
.
Disagreements
may
still
happen
,
but
you
learn
to
stay
calm
and
talk
about
how
you
feel
.
Talking
calmly
helps
you
to
understand
the
real
reason
for
not
getting
along
.
It
makes
it
much
easier
to
figure
out
how
to
fix
it
.
In
healthy
relationships
,
working
through
disagreements
often
makes
the
relationship
stronger
.
In
healthy
relationships
,
people
respect
each
other
for
who
they
are
.
This
includes
respecting
and
listening
to
yourself
and
your
feelings
so
you
can
set
boundaries
and
feel
comfortable
.
You
will
find
that
you
learn
to
understand
experiences
and
feelings
of
others
as
well
as
having
them
understand
your
experiences
and
feelings
.
 
How
do
I
know
that
I
have
a
healthy
relationship
with
someone
?
 
You
know
that

in
a

relationship
with
someone
because
you
feel
good
about
yourself
when
you
are
around
that
person
.
Unhealthy
relationships
can
make
you
feel
sad
,
angry
,
scared
,
or
worried
.
 
Healthy
peer
relationships
involve
an
equal
amount
of
giving
and
taking
in
the
relationship
.
In
unhealthy
relationships
,
there
is
an
unfair
balance
.
You
may
often
feel
that
you
are
giving
the
other
person
more
attention
than
that
he
or
she
gives
to
you
.
 
You
should
feel
safe
around
the
other
person
and
feel
that
you
can
trust
him
or
her
with
your
secrets
.
In
a
healthy
relationship
,
you
like
to
spend
time
with
the
other
person
,
instead
of
feeling
that
you
have
to
spend
time
with
him
or
her

"Black
has
long
been
praised
for
its
ability
to
better
women
's
figures
and
suit
every
occasion
.
But
the
color
has
a
side-effect
--
it
ages
the
face
.
 
While
black
does
give
the
appearance
of
a
slimmer
figure
by
making
the
shadows
less
visible
,
wearing
it
next
to
the
face
brings
out
a
negative
effect
.
Black
clothing
can
highlight
dark
lines
under
the
chin
,
shadows
around
the
eyes
and
wrinkles
on
the
face
.
The
effect
can
be
as
serious
as
making
women
feel
exhausted
,
self-conscious
and
upset
.
Wrinkles
and
sunken
areas
appear
deeper
and
more
pronounced
,
meaning
the
effect
is
more
obvious
in
older
women
.
 
Dark
scarves
,
hats
and
high-collared
coats
are
apparently
particularly
likely
to
emphasize
aging
features
of
the
face
.
But
fear
not
.
The
effect
can
be
tempered
by
a
splash
of
color
around
the
neck
--
in
the
form
of
a
scarf
or
a
piece
of
jewelry
--
or
a
low
neckline
.
 
Famous
actress
Joan
Collins
is
among
the
few
who
can
get
away
with
the
side-effect
.
But
those
who
should
consider
changing
their
dresses
include
many
European
stars
.
The
majority
of
women
who
have
what
is
known
as
a
""
warm
""
skin
tone
,
based
on
yellow
and
gold
colors
,
will
not
look
young
and
healthy
with
black
against
their
faces
.
Warm
skins
do
not
match
well
with
black
against
their
faces
as
it
takes
away
all
the
golden
glow
that
they
have
as
a
basic
skin
tone
.
Black
looks
for
dark
things
on
the
face
and
highlights
them
,
particularly
as
women
age
.
 
The
good
news
for
those
who
like
black
dress
is
that
a
simple
test
can
help
determine
whether
they
can
wear
black
well
:
Hold
the
color
up
against
your
face
,
stand
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
look
for
dark
lines
under
the
chin
,
shadows
around
the
eyes
or
lines
on
the
face
that
are
highlighted
.
If
there
are
no
dark
areas
or
shadows
,
you
can
probably
wear
black
close
to
your
face
and
look
great
.
Otherwise
,
change
your
ways

"Harvard
researchers
have
created
a
tough
,
low-cost
,
biodegradable
material
inspired
by
insects
'
hard
outer
shells
.
The
material
's
inventors
say
it
has
a
number
of
possible
uses
and
someday
could
provide
a
more
environmentally
friendly
alternative
to
plastic
.
The
material
,
made
from
shrimp
(
'
)
shells
and
proteins
produced
from
silk
,
is
called
""
shrilk
.
""
It
is
thin
,
clear
,
flexible
and
strong
.
 
A
major
benefit
of
the
material
is
its
biodegradability
.
Plastic
's
toughness
and
flexibility
represented
a
revolution
in
materials
science
during
the
1950s
and
'60s
.
Decades
later
,
however
,
plastic
's
very
durability
is
raising
questions
about
how
appropriate
it
is
for
one-time
products
such
as
plastic
bags
,
or
short-lived
consumer
goods
,
used
in
the
home
for
a
few
years
and
then
cast
into
a
landfill
where
they
will
degrade
for
centuries
.
What
is
the
point
of
making
something
that
lasts
1,000
years
?
 
Shrilk
not
only
will
degrade
in
a
landfill
,
but
its
basic
components
are
used
as
fertilizer
,
and
so
will
enrich
the
soil
.
 
Shrilk
has
great
potential
,
the
inventors
said
.
Materials
from
which
it
is
made
are
plentiful
in
nature
,
found
in
everything
ranging
from
shrimp
shells
,
insect
bodies
to
living
plants
.
That
makes
shrilk
low
cost
,
and
its
mass
production
possible
should
it
be
used
for
products
demanding
a
lot
of
material
.
 
Work
on
shrilk
is
continuing
in
the
lab
.
The
inventors
said
the
material
becomes
flexible
when
wet
,
so
they
're
exploring
ways
to
use
it
in
wet
environments
.
They
're
also
developing
simpler
production
processes
,
which
could
be
used
for
non-medical
products
,
like
for
computer
cases
and
other
products
inside
the
home
.
They
're
even
exploring
combining
it
with
other
materials
,
like
carbon
fibers
,
to
give
it
new
properties

"Both
are
so
much
related
to
each
other
.
And
both
are
so
dissimilar
!
What
are
the
differences
between
friendship
and
love
?
Is
platonic
friendship
possible
between
persons
of
opposite
sex
?
Let
us
try
and
understand
.
 
What
is
friendship
?
Why
do
we
call
a
person
our
friend
?
When
do
we
call
someone
a
very
good
friend
?
If
we
care
for
a
person
,
if
we
are
always
ready
to
help
that
person
and
if
we
share
most
of
our
thoughts
with
a
person
,
they
are
our
good
friends
.
We
can
always
count
upon
our
good
friends
in
an
emergency
.
We
are
always
sure
that
our
friend
will
understand
why
we
acted
in
a
certain
way
.
We
need
not
explain
anything
to
our
very
good
friends
.
The
friendship
is
so
deep
and
the
relationship
is
so
close
,
that
most
of
the
things
are
automatically
understood
by
our
friends
.
 
What
about
love
?
In
a
relationship
of
deep
love
,
all
the
sharing
that
we
discussed
above
are
taken
for
granted
.
But
love
transcends
all
these
.
During
love
,
we
are
attached
with
a
particular
person
,
while
in
friendship
,
one
may
have
many
friends
.
A
loving
relationship
makes
one
so
much
attached
to
the
other
,
that
one
gets
pained
if
his/her
beloved
is
hurt
!
Love
also
involves
a
physical
element
.
Friendship
does
not
have
that
.
This
is
a
vital
difference
.
Nature
gives
us
love
so
that
the
species
can
go
forward
.
Nature
does
not
give
us
friendship
.
 
Your
heart
beats
will
never
increase
in
expectation
of
meeting
your
friend
.
You
will
not
lie
awake
at
night
thinking
about
your
friend
.
You
will
not
feel
totally
lost
,
if
you
do
n't
meet
your
friend
for
a
few
days
.
You
will
not
have
dreams
in
your
eyes
thinking
about
your
friend
.
But
in
love
,
you
will
do
all
these
and
much
more
.
Indeed
,
there
is
no
comparison
between
love
and
friendship

"The
slogan
""
a
dog
is
for
life
,
not
just
for
Christmas
""
has
been
going
strong
for
27
years
now
.
Dogs
and
cats
have
been
popular
Christmas
gifts
in
the
gifts
in
the
UK
and
Europe
for
many
years
.
But
some
people
still
have
n't
quite
got
the
message
.
 
The
slogan
still
holds
good
.
Some
105,000
dogs
were
rounded
up
by
local
government
last
year
because
they
had
been
abandoned
,
many
of
them
shortly
after
the
festival
season
.
 
The
main
reason
given
by
owners
for
handing
their
dogs
over
to
the
Dogs
Trust
is
that
the
dogs
need
more
attention
than
they
can
give
;
behavioral
problems
and
moving
home
are
also
reasons
given
.
 
But
Eleanor
Silk
,
the
Trust
's
communications
director
,
says
,
""
It
's
often
four
or
five
months
after
Christmas
,
in
early
summer
,
when
owners
find
that
the
dog
has
got
too
big
and
too
active
,
or
it
has
n't
been
trained
properly
and
has
caused
damage
around
the
home
.
""
 
In
any
case
,
some
organizations
that
help
pets
are
quick
to
point
out
that
if
you
are
serious
about
getting
a
puppy
as
a
pet
,
Christmas
is
not
the
time
to
do
it
.
Puppies
need
to
get
used
to
their
new
surroundings
,
to
be
introduced
to
a
routine
,
and
to
be
looked
after
like
small
children
.
It
's
hard
to
meet
any
of
these
needs
at
Christmas
.
What
's
more
,
pulling
a
puppy
out
of
a
Christmas
stocking
in
itself
sends
the
wrong
message
to
children
.
It
encourages
children
to
think
of
the
puppy
as
a
toy
,
rather
than
a
responsibility
.
 
Appreciating
what
you
're
taking
on
with
a
dog
can
be
a
sobering
realization
.
""
For
life
""
means
thinking
about
the
effect
they
'll
have
on
your
life
.
It
also
infers
you
will
need
to
care
for
the
dog
for
its
whole
life

"I
like
watching
butterflies

Sometimes
I
think
I
'm
the
only
girl
who
notices
these
quiet
but
beautiful
things
.
But
if
it
had
n't
been
for
a
crowded
restaurant
,
I
would
n't
have
ever
noticed
Valeri
.
 
Valeri
was
a
new
student
.
She
walked
to
class
with
her
books
against
her
chest
and
her
head
down
.
She
talked
only
when
the
teacher
asked
her
a
question
.
After
a
month
at
our
school
,
she
had
n't
made
any
friend
.
 
One
day
at
lunch
,
most
tables
being
full
,
I
had
nowhere
to
sit
.
Valeri
sat
alone
,
book
in
hand
.
I
walked
over
to
her
,
""
Is
that
a
good
book
?
""
Valeri
gave
a
small
nod
and
went
back
to
reading
.
""
What
's
it
about
?
""
I
asked
.
After
seconds
of
silence
,
she
looked
at
me
,
her
eyes
shining
,
""
Well
,
it
's
about
a
dragon
!
This
boy
,
Eragon
,
finds
this
dragon
egg
when
he
goes
playing
one
day
.
He
thinks
it
's
a
rock
!
The
egg
hatches
and
Eragon
hides
the
dragon
from
his
cousin
and
uncle
until
it
gets
too
big
.
""
 
Two
weeks
later
,
I
was
sitting
in
the
auditorium
enjoying
the
talent
show
.
Then
a
shy
girl
walked
on
stage
.
I
recognized
her
immediately
.
Valeri
held
a
violin
in
one
hand
and
a
bow
in
the
other
.
She
started
to
play
.
The
notes
formed
a
soft
,
sweet
tune
.
The
auditorium
fell
completely
silent
until
we
realized
the
music
was

I
smiled
to
myself
.
Valeri
was
n't
just
""
a
quiet
girl
""
.
She
knew
about
wonderful
books
and
could
play
the
violin
like
nothing
I
'd
ever
heard
.
Like
a
butterfly
,
she
was
beautiful
and
amazing
when
you
looked
closely

"The
Japanese
have
always
loved
fresh
fish
.
But
the
waters
close
to
Japan
have
not
held
many
fish
for
decades
.
So
fishing
boats
went
farther
than
ever.but
If
the
return
trip
took
more
than
a
few
days
,
the
fish
were
not
fresh
.
The
Japanese
did
not
like
the
taste
.
 
Then
fishing
companies
equipped
their
boats
with
freezers
.
They
would
freeze
them
at
sea
.
Freezers
allowed
the
boats
to
go
farther
and
stay
longer
.
However
,
the
Japanese
could
taste
the
difference
between
fresh
and
frozen
and
they
did
not
like
frozen
fish
.
 
So
fishing
boats
were
equipped
with
fish
tanks
.
They
would
stuff
fish
in
the
tanks
,
fin
to
fin
.
After
a
little
thrashing
around
,
the
fish
stopped
moving
.
They
were
tired
and
dull
,
but
alive
.
Unfortunately
,
the
Japanese
could
still
taste
the
difference
.
The
Japanese
preferred
the
lively
taste
of
fresh
fish
,
not
sluggish
fish
.
 
To
keep
the
fish
tasting
fresh
,
the
Japanese
fishing
companies
still
put
the
fish
in
the
tanks
.
But
now
they
add
a
small
shark
to
each
tank
.
The
shark
eats
a
few
fish
,
but
most
of
the
fish
arrive
in
a
very
lively
state
.
The
fish
are
challenged
.
 
Have
you
realized
that
some
of
us
are
also
living
in
a
tank
but
most
of
the
time
tired
&
dull
,
so
we
need
a
Shark
in
our
life
to
keep
us
awake
and
moving
.
If
your
challenges
are
the
correct
size
,
and
if
you
are
regularly
defeating
those
challenges
,
you
are
Conqueror
.
You
think
of
your
challenges
and
get
energized
.
You
are
excited
to
try
new
solutions
.
You
are
alive
!
Here
is
some
advice
for
you
:
 
1
.
Instead
of
avoiding
challenges
,
jump
into
them
and
enjoy
the
game
.
If
your
challenges
are
too
large
or
too
numerous
,
do
not
give
up
.
Instead
,
reorganize
.
Find
more
determination
,
more
knowledge
,
more
help
.
 
2
.
God
did
n't
promise
days
without
pain
,
laughter
without
sorrow
,
sun
without
rain
,
but
he
did
promise
strength
for
the
day
,
comfort
for
the
tears
and
light
for
the
way
.
 
3
.
Disappointments
are
like
road
blocks
,
they
slow
you
down
a
bit
but
you
enjoy
the
smooth
road
afterwards
.
Do
n't
stay
on
the
bumps
too
long
.
Move
on

"Travel
to
China
is
a
lifetime
experience
and
a
better
way
to
understand
China
.
Only
when
you
are
there
,
you
may
start
to
appreciate
and
understand
what
a
difference
to
live
in
a
nation
with
a
population
of
1.3
billion
.
 
China
offers
variety
choices
for
visitors
.
If
you
are
interested
in
Chinese
history
,
Chinese
culture
and
Chinese
scenery
,
your
trip
will
be
very
fulfilled
and
very
interesting
.
If
you
want
to
enjoy
a
peaceful
sunshine
beach
holiday
,
there
are
plenty
of
tourist
areas
along
the
coastal
line
,
which
have
unspoiled
beaches
and
luxury
hotels
for
visitors
.
In
Hainan
Island
,
the
beautiful
Sanya
beaches
are
opened
the
whole
year
around
and
there
is
no
winter
in
this
island
.
If
you
want
excitements
and
nightlife
,
stay
in
big
cities
.
There
are
many
places
every
night
for
international
gathering
.
If
you
are
adventurers
,
go
to
remote
areas
to
watch
wild
life
or
visit
minorities
to
see
how
they
live
in
the
hillsides
or
desert
.
If
you
are
sporty
,
take
a
cycle
trip
along
the
countryside
,
enjoy
the
rural
life
and
meet
with
Chinese
people
long
the
route
.
 
You
may
have
heard
or
read
a
lot
about
China
from
books
,
newspapers
,
magazines
and
TV
programs
.
Some
of
them
are
true
but
most
of
them
are
out
of
date
,
incorrect
or
even
false
.
China
is
different
from
many
of
your
previous
experiences
and
may
shock
you
in
many
ways
.
This
is
what
China
is
!
 
This
country
is
changing
and
progressing
every
day
.
Yet
it
is
still
a
developing
country
.
After
the
economic
reform
,
most
of
the
developments
concentrate
in
major
cities
and
remote
areas
are
still
very
backward
.
China
is
a
very
populated
nation
and
people
have
to
cope
with
the
crowded
environment
.
Foreign
visitors
may
not
get
used
to
the
mentality
of
the
people
and
sometimes
become
frustrated
with
the
situation
,
which
they
never
experienced
before
.
Basically
Chinese
are
reserve
,
peaceful
and
nice
.
They
are
very
polite
too
but
in
their
own
way
.
When
a
foreigner
is
willing
to
take
a
more
positive
attitude
to
recognize
the
difference
,
the
trip
will
become
worthwhile
or
you
may
ruin
your
trip
completely
by
unreasonable
expectation
and
misjudgment
of
the
people
in
general

"Poet
William
Stafford
once
said
that
we
are
defined
more
by
the
detours
in
life
than
by
the
narrow
road
toward
goals
.
I
like
this
image
.
But
it
was
quite
by
accident
that
I
discovered
the
deep
meaning
of
his
words
.
 
For
years
we
made
the
long
drive
from
our
home
in
Seattle
to
my
parents
'
home
in
Boise
in
nine
hours
.
We
traveled
the
way
most
people
do
:
the
fastest
,
shortest
,
easiest
road
,
especially
when
I
was
alone
with
four
noisy
,
restless
kids
who
hate
confinement
and
have
strong
opinions
about
everything
.
 
Road
trips
felt
risky
,
so
I
would
drive
fast
,
stopping
only
when
I
had
to
.
We
would
stick
to
the
freeways
and
arrive
tired
.
 
But
then
Banner
,
our
lamb
was
born
.
He
was
rejected
by
his
mama
days
before
our
planned
trip
to
Boise
.
I
had
two
choices
:
leave
Banner
with
my
husband
,
or
take
him
with
me
.
My
husband
made
the
decision
for
me
.
 
That
is
how
I
found
myself
on
the
road
with
four
kids
,
a
baby
lamb
and
nothing
but
my
everlasting
optimism
to
see
me
through
.
We
took
the
country
roads
out
of
necessity
.
We
had
to
stop
every
hour
,
let
Banner
shake
out
his
legs
and
feed
him
.
The
kids
chased
him
and
one
another
.
They
'd
get
back
in
the
car
breathless
and
energized
,
smelling
fresh
from
the
cold
air
.
 
We
explored
side
roads
,
catching
grasshoppers
in
waisthigh
grass
.
Even
if
we
simply
looked
out
of
the
car
windows
at
baby
pigs
following
their
mother
,
or
fish
leaping
out
of
the
water
,
it
was
better
than
the
best
ride
down
the
freeway
.
Here
was
life
.
And
new
horizons
.
 
We
eventually
arrived
at
my
parents
'
doorstep
astonishingly
fresh
and
full
of
stories
.
 
I
grew
brave
with
the
trip
back
home
and
creative
with
my
disciplining
technique
.
On
an
empty
section
of
road
,
everyone
started
quarreling
.
I
stopped
the
car
,
ordered
all
kids
out
and
told
them
to
meet
me
up
ahead
.
I
parked
my
car
half
a
mile
away
and
read
my
book
in
sweet
silence
.
 
Some
road
trips
are
by
necessity
fast
and
straight
.
But
that
trip
with
Banner
opened
our
eyes
to
a
world
available
to
anyone
adventurous
enough
to
wander
around
and
made
me
realize
that
a
detour
may
uncover
the
best
part
of
a
journey-and
the
best
part
of
yourself

"Body
language
is
a
very
powerful
tool
of
a
communication
,
not
only
between
people
but
in
the
animal
world
as
well
.
 
In
many
instances
,
we
produce
idioms
which
are
all
understandable
by
borrowing
examples
from
animal
communication
.
 
For
example
,
we
know
that
a
frightened
cat
will
arch
.
From
this
starting-point
we
might
hear
the
expression
.
""
He
gets
my
back
up
!
""
meaning
""
He
makes
me
angry
.
""
 
In
the
same
manner
,
we
know
that
many
animals
,
if
challenged
by
attackers
,
will
not
turn
and
run
away
because
this
will
encourage
the
attackers
to
attack
them
more
forcefully
.
Instead
,
they
will
move
backwards
slowly
to
get
out
of
harm
's
way
,
always
facing
their
attacker
.
We
call
this
action
""
backing
off
""
and
it
can
be
used
as
well
with
humans
as
with
animals
.
 
In
the
case
of
humans
,
however
,
the
back-off
may
not
be
physical
but
oral
,
as
in
using
a
kinder
tone
of
voice
and
gentle
words
instead
of
fighting
against
the
attackers

"Three
Central
Texas
men
were
honored
with
the
Texas
Department
of
Public
Safety
's
Director
's
Award
in
a
Tuesday
morning
ceremony
for
their
heroism
in
saving
the
victims
of
a
fiery
two
car
accident
.
 
The
accident
occurred
on
March
25
when
a
vehicle
lost
control
while
traveling
on
a
rain-soaked
State
Highway
6
near
Baylor
Camp
Road
.
It
ran
into
an
oncoming
vehicle
,
leaving
the
occupants
trapped
inside
as
both
vehicles
burst
into
flames
.
 
Bonge
was
the
first
on
the
scene
and
heard
children
screaming
.
He
broke
through
a
back
window
and
pulled
Mallory
Smith
,
10
,
and
her
sister
,
Megan
Smith,9
,
from
the
wreckage
.
 
The
girls
'
mother
,
Beckie
Smith
,
was
not
with
them
at
the
time
of
the
wreck
,
as
they
were
traveling
with
their
baby
sitter
,
Lisa
Bow
bin
.
 
Beckie
Smith
still
remembers
the
sickening
feeling
she
had
up
on
receiving
the
call
informing
her
of
the
wreck
and
the
despair
as
she
drove
to
the
scene
.
 
Bozeman
and
Clemmons
arrived
shortly
after
Bonge
and
helped
rescue
the
other
victims
and
attempted
to
put
out
the
fires
.
 
""
I
was
nervous
,
""
Bozeman
said
.
""
I
do
n't
feel
like
I
'm
a
hero
.
I
was
just
doing
what
anyone
should
do
in
that
situation
.
I
hope
someone
would
do
the
same
for
me
.
""
 
Everyone
at
the
accident
made
it
out
alive
,
with
the
victims
suffering
from
nonlife-threatening
injuries
.
Mallory
Smith
broke
both
femurs
,
and
Megan
had
neck
and
back
injuries
.
Bowbin
is
still
recovering
from
a
broken
pelvis
,
ankle
and
foot
.
 
The
rescuers
also
were
taken
to
the
hospital
and
treated
for
cuts
and
smoke
breathing
,
Bonge
said
.
 
In
addition
,
Bozeman
not
to
meet
accident
victim
Anthony
Rus
so
in
the
hospital
after
the
accident
,
where
Russo
presented
him
with
a
glass
frame
inscribed
with
""
Thank
you
,
""
Bozeman
said
.
Those
involved
in
that
fateful
encounter
on
Highway
6
credited
God
blessing
for
bringing
them
together
.
 
""
Whatever
the
circumstances
,
Tuesday
's
ceremony
provided
a
time
to
be
grateful
for
those
who
put
their
lives
on
the
line
for
the
lives
of
complete
strangers

it

"We
've
all
heard
the
phrase
""
love
is
patient
""
,
but
one
couple
in
prefix
=
st1
/Michigan
,
took
this
phrase
to
a
whole
new
level
.
On
Monday
,
February
13
,
Willard
Mason
sat
down
to
talk
about
his
relationship
with
the
love
he
lost
more
than
60
years
ago
.
Good
fortune
and
fate
recently
helped
the
couple
reunite
.
 
In
1941
,
Willard
Mason
and
Llah
Ost
,
both
senior
2
students
,
became
engaged
to
be
married
and
began
planning
their
lives
together
.
But
Willard
moved
away
to
work
at
Willow
Run
Bomber
Plant
,
where
he
met
and
fell
in
love
with
a
woman
named
Helvi
.
He
broke
off
his
long
distance
engagement
to
Llah
and
married
Helvi
in
1942
.
Llah
later
found
love
with
someone
else
.
Both
had
happy
marriages
and
raised
families
.
 
Then
,
in
2003
,
Helvi
died
.
A
year
later
,
Willard
found
himself
back
in
his
hometown
,
where
by
chance
,
he
ran
into
Llah
's
brother
.
He
informed
Willard
of
the
death
of
Llah
's
husband
,
and
encouraged
him
to
call
her
.
 
After
that
first
phone
call
,
the
couple
began
dating
.
Willard
made
the
drive
from
his
home
near
Houghton
Lake
to
Llah
's
home
in
Adrian
.
On
one
such
trip
,
he
blacked
out
,
and
his
car
hit
a
tree
.
He
was
rushed
to
a
hospital
,
where
tests
showed
that
he
needed
a
new
pacemaker
.
Willard
moved
closer
to
Adrianand
asked
Llah
to
move
in
with
him
.
She
gladly
accepted
.
 
""
We
get
along
perfectly
,
""
Willard
told
AZ
Central
on
Monday
.
""
We
've
never
had
an
argument
,
she
's
a
great
cook
,
and
she
takes
care
of
me
.
""
 
Although
both
Willard
and
Llah
are
saddened
by
the
62
years
they
spent
without
each
other
,
neither
seem
to
have
any
regrets
.
Willard
told
AZ
Central
,
""
You
do
n't
know
how
our
lives
might
have
turned
out
if
we
'd
gotten
married
in
1941
,
but
now
she
has
a
wonderful
family
,
and
so
do
I

"If
you
had
a
strange
sound
in
your
ear
,
what
would
you
do
?
One
man
in
Wales
who
thought
he
had
a
fly
in
his
ear
called
999
,
the
emergency
services
number
in
Britain
.
And
so
did
a
woman
who
was
worried
about
her
green
potatoes
.
Could
she
make
chips
with
them
?
Were
they
poisonous
?
She
did
n't
hesitate
about
calling
the
local
ambulance
service
to
ask
.
According
to
a
recent
report
,
more
than
31,000
non-urgent
calls
were
made
to
the
Welsh
Ambulance
Service
in
the
last
year
.
 
Inappropriate
calls
are
a
headache
for
health
professionals
everywhere
.
In
the
US
,
prank
calls
to
911
happen
on
a
daily
basis
.
Many
callers
use
apps
which
hide
their
identity
.
But
those
who
try
to
be
funny
should
n't
be
surprised
if
the
police
have
the
last
laugh
.
One
man
from
Colorado
was
arrested
for
making
more
than
1,200
prank
calls
,
according
to
a
report
on
the
US
television
station
KOAA
--
TV
.
 
People
who
take
these
calls
are
trained
to
stay
calm
and
keep
a
straight
face
,
no
matter
how
strange
the
call
sounds
.
""
There
's
no
way
for
us
to
know
whether
the
call
is
real
,
accidental
or
a
prank
call
,
""
said
a
public
safety
worker
interviewed
by
the
American
TV
channel
.
 
The
Head
of
Clinical
Services
at
the
Welsh
Ambulance
Service
,
Richard
Lee
,
has
a
warning
for
prank
callers
.
He
says
:
""
When
people
misuse
the
service
it
means
our
precious
time
is
being
taken
away
from
someone
who
really
does
need
our
help
.
""
Indeed
,
these
hotlines
are
supposed
to
help
the
seriously
ill
or
those
with
a
life-threatening
injury
.
You
never
know
,
one
day
,
the
person
who
needs
assistance
could
be
you
or
someone
in
your
family

"When
I
was
in
my
fourth
year
of
teaching
,
I
was
also
(
and
am
still
)
a
high
school
track
and
field
coach
.
One
year
,
I
had
a
student
,
John
,
who
entered
my
class
when
he
was
a
junior
.
John
changed
to
our
school
from
Greece
,
and
seemed
to
be
interested
in
athletics
,
so
I
encouraged
him
to
join
our
track
team
.
I
explained
to
him
that
even
though
he
had
never
taken
part
in
it
before
,
I
did
believe
that
he
could
do
well
in
any
event
,
and
I
would
be
willing
to
coach
him
at
whichever
ones
interested
him
.
He
accepted
the
offer
,
and
began
to
work
hard
at
every
practice
.
 
About
a
month
later
,
I
had
found
out
from
other
sources
that
John
was
a
first-class
tennis
player
,
winning
various
junior
awards
in
his
home
country
.
I
went
to
him
asking
,
""
John
,
I
really
appreciate
that
you
came
out
for
the
track
team
,
but
why
did
n't
you
play
tennis
instead
?
It
seems
that
would
interest
you
a
lot
more
,
since
you
're
so
good
at
it
.
""
 
John
answered
,
""
Well
,
I
like
tennis
,
but
you
told
me
that
you
believed
in
me
,
and
that
you
thought
I
could
do
well
in
track
,
so
I
wanted
to
try
it
for
that
reason
.
""
 
From
then
on
,
I
often
remember
my
student
's
reply
.
I
told
it
to
a
friend
and
she
suggested
I
write
it
down
to
share
somewhere
with
more
teachers
.
No
matter
how
critical
students
can
be
of
themselves
,
I
've
found
that
a
simple
""
I
trust
that
you
can
do
it
!
""
can
go
a
long
way
!"	"315

"A
new
study
warns
that
about
thirty
percent
of
the
world
's
people
may
not
have
enough
water
by
the
year
2025
.
 
An
American
organization
called
Population
Action
International
did
the
new
study
.
It
was
more
than
three
hundred
and
thirty-five
million
people
lack
enough
water
now
.
The
people
live
in
twenty-eight
countries
.
Most
of
the
countries
are
in
Africa
or
in
the
Middle
East
.
 
Population
Action
International
researcher
Robert
Engelman
says
by
the
year
2025
,
about
three
thousand
million
people
lack
water
.
At
least
18
more
countries
are
expected
to
have
serious
water
problems
.
The
demand
for
water
keeps
increasing
.
Yet
the
amount
of
water
on
the
earth
the
same
.
Mr
Engelman
says
the
population
in
countries
that
lack
water
is
growing
in
these
countries
will
continue
to
increase
.
 
The
report
says
lack
of
water
in
the
future
may
result
several
problems
.
It
may
increase
health
problems
.
Lack
of
water
often
means
drinking
water
is
not
safe
.
Mr
Engelman
says
there
are
problems
all
over
the
world
because
of
diseases
such
as
cholera
that
are
carried
in
water
.
 
Lack
of
water
also
may
result
in
more
international
conflict
.
Countries
may
have
to
fight
for
water
in
the
future
.
Some
countries
,
such
as
Syria
,
Sudan
,
Cambodia
,
and
so
on
,
now
get
sixty
percent
of
their
fresh
water
from
other
countries
.
And
the
report
says
lack
of
water
would
affect
the
ability
to
improve
their
economies
.
This
is
because
industries
often
need
a
large
amount
of
water
.
 
The
Population
Action
International
study
gives
several
ways
to
solve
the
water
problem
.
One
way
is
to
find
ways
to
use
water
for
more
than
one
purpose
.
Another
way
is
to
teach
people
to
be
careful
not
to
waste
water
.
A
third
is
to
use
less
water
for
agriculture
.
The
report
also
says
long-term
solutions
to
the
water
problem
must
include
controls
on
population
growth

"Culture
helps
human
societies
survive
in
changing
natural
environment
.
For
example
,
the
end
of
the
last
Ice
Age
,
beginning
about
15,000
years
ago
,
brought
a
big
challenge
to
which
humans
had
to
adapt
.
Before
this
time
,
large
parts
of
the
northern
hemisphere
were
covered
in
great
sheets
of
ice
that
contained
much
of
the
earth
'
s
water
.
In
North
America
,
large
animals
that
wandered
the
vast
tundra
provided
people
with
food
and
materials
for
clothing
and
simple
shelters
.
When
the
earth
became
warm
,
large
Ice
Age
animals
disappeared
,
and
many
land
areas
were
covered
by
rising
sea
levels
from
melting
ice
.
But
people
survived
,
they
developed
new
technologies
and
learned
how
to
survive
on
new
plant
and
animal
species
.
Finally
some
people
settled
into
permanent
villages
,
durable
houses
and
farms
.
 
Cultural
adaptation
has
made
humans
one
of
the
most
successful
species
on
the
planet
.
Through
history
,
major
developments
in
technology
,
medicine
,
and
nutrition
have
allowed
people
to
reproduce
and
survive
in
ever-increasing
numbers
.
The
global
population
has
risen
from
8
million
during
the
Ice
Age
to
about
6
billion
today
.
 
However
,
the
successes
of
culture
adaptation
can
also
create
problems
in
the
long
run
.
Over
the
last
200
years
,
people
have
begun
to
use
large
quantities
of
natural
resources
and
energy
and
to
produce
a
great
amount
of
material
and
chemical
wastes
.
The
global
population
now
consumes
some
important
natural
resources
--
such
as
petroleum
,
wood
,
and
minerals
--
faster
than
nature
can
produce
them
.
Many
scientists
believe
that
in
the
process
of
burning
fuels
and
producing
wastes
,
people
may
be
changing
the
global
climate
in
unpredictable
and
possibly
harmful
ways
.
Thus
,
the
adaptive
success
of
the
present-day
global
culture
of
production
and
trade
may
be
temporary

"My
first
day
of
high
school
was
like
any
other
first
day
:
registering
?
finding
new
classmates
,
meeting
new
teachers
,
and
seeking
new
friends
.
 
During
lunch
,
I
ran
into
my
first
snag
of
the
day
.
At
the
dining
hall
,
as
the
checkout
lady
asked
for
my
money
,
I
realized
that
I
had
forgotten
my
lunch
money
.
When
I
told
her
about
it
,
I
heard
a
voice
behind
me
.
I
turned
around
and
there
stood
a
teacher
telling
her
he
would
pay
for
my
lunch
.
He
told
me
his
name
,
Mr.
Pete
Walker
,
and
said
,
""
If
you
get
a
chance
,
you
should
take
my
history
class
.
""
I
recognized
his
name
,
and
told
him
I
was
in
his
class
later
that
day
.
Mr.
Walker
befriended
me
on
the.very
first
clay
of
school
at
a
very
crucial
time
of
the
day
--
lunch
!
 
He
always
told
us
we
should
do
more
than
we
ever
thought.he
pushes
us
to
clod
all
things
better
.
He
coached
many
sports
,
and
sponsored
many
after-class
activities
.
If
we
were
interested
in
something
,
he
would
find
a
way
to
expose
us
to
it
by
inviting
speakers
,
taking
us
on
field
trips
,
or
obtaining
information
for
us
.
 
Two
years
later
,
my
junior
year
in
school
was
clicking
along
nicely
when
one
day
I
was
riding
my
motorcycle
and
I
was
hit
by
a
car
.
I
spent
six
days
in
hospital
and
was
at
home
in
bed
for
two
weeks
before
returning
to
school
.
Mr.
Walker
stopped
by
the
hospital
each
day
with
my
work
from
my
teachers
.
Once
I
was
at
home
,
he
would
bring
my
work
too
.
 
After
high
school
,
I
attended
the
United
States
Army
Airborne
School
in
Fort
I3enning
,
Georgia
.
I
knew
my
parents
woolly
be
there
the
day
I
graduates
,
but
they
brought
an
unexpected
guest
.
They
came
across
Mr.
Walker
at
lunch
several
days
before
and
told
him
I
was
about
to
graduate
.
His
visit
,
however
,
was
not
a
surprise
to
me

"The
first
time
my
father
and
I
ever
went
fishing
became
a
family
legend
.
We
spent
hours
waiting
for
a
bite
.
The
sun
was
bursting
with
fire
.
We
were
hot
,
sticky
,
and
mad
that
the
fish
refused
to
suck
up
our
night
crawlers
.
 
Being
only
seven
years
old
,
I
observed
that
perhaps
the
worms
were
the
problem
.
Maybe
the
night
crawlers
only
moved
at
night
,
and
now
they
were
just
lying
there
motionless
on
the
hook
.
Dad
ignored
my
assessment
of
the
situation
.
 
We
began
to
pack
up
to
leave
.
As
we
headed
back
to
our
truck
,
we
heard
tires
spinning
in
the
distance
.
Getting
into
our
truck
was
tough
.
Having
sat
in
the
boiling
sun
for
six
hours
,
the
seats
were
blistering
.
Naturally
,
I
was
wearing
shorts
.
 
I
shifted
from
side
to
side
in
the
seat
so
as
not
to
cook
my
bottom
.
While
driving
out
we
saw
a
truck
with
a
boat
trailer
and
boat
that
was
stuck
in
the
mud
.
That
explained
the
sound
of
spinning
tires
we
'd
heard
.
 
Being
a
nice
guy
,
my
dad
helped
pull
the
man
from
the
mud
.
In
return
,
this
fellow
gave
Dad
some
fish
for
being
a
Good
Samaritan
.
As
Dad
climbed
back
into
our
truck
with
a
brown
bag
full
of
fish
,
we
waved
goodbye
to
our
newfound
friend
.
 
On
the
drive
home
,
we
agreed
to
take
in
the
fish
as
if
we
had
caught
them
.
We
were
sure
there
was
no
way
for
Mom
to
know
the
difference
.
It
was
just
a
little
white
lie
.
 
We
arrived
home
hot
,
sweaty
,
and
smelly
,
and
went
to
clean
up
while
Mom
prepared
the
fish
.
We
made
a
big
deal
out
of
the
fact
that
we
had
already
cleaned
them
and
put
them
in
the
bag
so
as
not
to
make
a
mess
.
 
After
showering
,
Dad
and
I
met
in
the
hall
and
exchanged
conspiratorial
grins
.
Sitting
down
to
freshly
fried
fish
,
we
started
eating
happily
and
went
on
about
how
good
something
tasted
that
we
had
actually
caught
ourselves
.
Mother
looked
suitably
impressed
.
 
As
we
got
up
to
do
the
dishes
,
Mom
cleared
her
throat
.
""
I
just
have
one
question
of
you
two
great
fishermen
,
""
she
said
.
We
looked
at
her
expectantly
,
thinking
we
had
another
opportunity
to
delight
her
with
our
great
fishing
ability
.
With
a
tiny
smile
,
Mom
asked
,
""
How
was
it
again
that
you
two
managed
to
not
only
clean
your
fish
,
but
also
freeze
them
before
you
got
home
.

"I
'm
sure
your
parents
love
you
and
would
love
you
even
if
you
did
n't
live
up
to
their
expectations
,
They
are
probably
setting
the
bar
as
high
as
possible
,
so
that
you
will
aim
high
,
That
's
right
,
but
you
need
some
confidence
that
they
'll
be
there
to
catch
you
--
and
love
you
just
the
same
--
if
you
try
and
fail
to
achieve
all
their
goals
,
Because
what
they
're
doing
now
could
lead
to
some
unexpected
results
.and
not
good
ones
.
 
Giving
you
a
lecture
for
achieving
an
A
is
a
big
mistake
,
Your
parents
might
think
they
're
giving
you
the
motivation
for
succeeding
,
but
all
this
pressure
is
making
you
feel
like
you
can
never
be
good
enough
,
The
risk
is
that
you
'll
stop
trying
anything
unless
you
are
sure
you
'll
be
the
best
at
it
.
And
that
can
actually
cause
your
grades
to
fall
downwards
,
creating
the
opposite
effect
than
you
parents
indeed
.
 
Show
your
parents
this
letter
that
you
wrote
to
me
,
Tell
them
that
you
love
them
so
much
,
and
you
worry
they
wo
n't
love
you
if
you
do
n't
achieve
what
they
want
,
and
how
you
suspect
you
may
not
be
up
to
the
challenge
,
Explain
that
you
have
other
qualities
that
you
wish
they
would
value
you
for
--
such
as
your
kindness
,
your
sense
of
humor
,
your
willingness
to
try
and
try
again
,
and
so
on
.
 
Have
an
honest
talk
with
your
parents
about
how
all
this
pressure
to
be
perfect
is
affecting
you
,
If
he
talk
does
n't
go
the
way
you
hope
,
you
might
want
to
schedule
a
meeting
between
you
,
your
parents
and
a
counselor
at
school
,
The
counselor
can
certainly
help
your
parents
understand
how
this
kind
of
unhealthy
pressure
can
lead
to
negative
results
,
and
give
them
advice
about
how
to
better
encourage
you
to
be
all
that
you
can
be
,
at
school
and
outside

"Everyone
,
please
think
of
your
biggest
personal
goal
.
For
real
-
you
can
take
a
second
.
You
've
got
to
feel
this
to
learn
it
.
Take
a
few
seconds
and
think
of
your
personal
biggest
goal
,
okay
?
Imagine
deciding
right
now
that
you
're
going
to
do
it
.
Imagine
telling
someone
that
you
meet
today
what
you
're
going
to
do
.
Imagine
their
congratulations
and
their
high
image
of
you
.
Does
n't
it
feel
good
to
say
it
out
loud
?
Do
n't
you
feel
one
step
closer
already
,
like
it
's
already
becoming
part
of
your
identity
?
 
Well
,
bad
news
:
you
should
have
kept
your
mouth
shut
,
because
that
good
feeling
now
will
make
you
less
likely
to
do
it
.
Repeated
psychology
tests
have
proved
that
telling
someone
your
goal
makes
it
less
likely
to
happen
.
Any
time
you
have
a
goal
,
there
are
some
steps
that
need
to
be
done
,
some
work
that
needs
to
be
done
in
order
to
achieve
it
.
Ideally
,
you
would
not
be
satisfied
until
you
had
actually
done
the
work
.
But
when
you
tell
someone
your
goal
and
they
acknowledge
it
,
psychologists
have
found
that
it
's
called
a
""
social
reality
""
.
The
mind
is
kind
of
tricked
into
feeling
that
it
's
already
done
.
And
then
,
because
you
felt
that
satisfaction
,
you
're
less
motivated
to
do
the
actual
hard
work
necessary
.
So
,
this
goes
against
the
conventional
wisdom
that
we
should
tell
our
friends
our
goals
.
 
Peter
Gollwitzer
wrote
a
whole
book
about
this
and
in
2009
,
he
did
some
new
tests
that
were
published
.
 
It
goes
like
this
:
163
people
across
four
separate
tests
-
everyone
wrote
down
their
personal
goals
.
Then
,
half
of
them
announced
their
commitment
to
this
goal
to
the
room
,
and
half
did
n't
.
Then
everyone
was
given
45
minutes
of
work
that
would
directly
lead
them
toward
their
goals
,
but
they
were
told
that
they
could
stop
at
any
time
.
Now
,
those
who
kept
their
mouths
shut
worked
the
entire
45
minutes
,
on
average
,
and
when
asked
afterward
,
said
that
they
felt
that
they
had
a
long
way
to
go
to
still
achieve
their
goals
.
But
those
who
had
announced
it
quit
after
only
33
minutes
,
on
average
,
and
when
asked
afterward
,
said
that
they
felt
much
closer
to
achieving
their
goals
.
 
So
audience
,
next
time
you
want
to
tell
someone
your
goal
,
what
will
you
say
?
(
Silence
)
Exactly
-
well
done

"When
my
friend
went
to
Europe
last
summer
,
instead
of
snapping
photographs
of
the
Louvre
or
the
Eiffel
Tower
or
Stonehenge
,
she
brought
back
32
rolls
of
...
cathedral
ceilings
.
Ceilings
.
For
the
10
years
I
've
known
her
I
had
never
suspected
that
she
was
this
passionate
about
stained
glass
.
 
Still
one
of
the
best
things
about
such
pictures
--
despite
their
obvious
narrow
appeal
--
is
that
they
ca
n't
help
but
tell
us
a
great
deal
about
the
people
who
took
them
.
 
So
I
should
n't
have
been
surprised
when
I
got
the
roll
of
film
back
from
my
5-year-old
son
's
first
camping
trip
.
I
opened
the
envelope
,
naively
expecting
to
see
pictures
of
the
nightly
campfire
,
the
sun
setting
over
the
forest
,
and
possibly
even
a
deer
or
two
.
 
Instead
,
I
saw
an
off-center
picture
of
tennis
shoes
.
Not
even
his
tennis
shoes
,
mind
you
,
but
a
pair
someone
had
lost
and
left
in
the
cabin
.
Mystery
shoes
.
And
that
's
not
all
.
 
As
I
went
through
the
stack
,
I
found
that
my
son
had
also
taken
a
picture
of
his
sleeping
bag
,
a
penny
he
found
in
the
gravel
next
to
the
car
,
a
leaf
,
an
orange
sock
,
a
close-up
of
his
father
's
ear
,
a
burned
hot
dog
,
his
thumb
,
a
piece
of
gum
,
and
many
other
similar
things
.
 
There
was
barely
one
sign
of
nature
in
the
whole
stack
.
I
could
n't
help
thinking
that
if
he
'd
wanted
pictures
of
assorted
junk
,
it
would
've
been
cheaper
had
he
spent
the
weekend
in
our
back-yard
.
 
AT
LEAST
that
is
what
I
thought
until
I
showed
the
photographs
to
my
ceiling-snapping
friend
,
the
mother
of
three
teenagers
,
who
said
simply
,
""
There
's
nothing
wrong
with
these

""
 
But
of
course
,
this
is
just
the
type
of
answer
you
'd
expect
from
someone
who
photographs
ceiling
.
 
Then
she
told
me
about
the
time
her
daughter
went
to
Yosemite
Valley
and
returned
with
rolls
of
photographs
of
the
hotel
,
restaurant
,
and
gift
shop
.
She
also
told
me
about
the
time
her
son
took
his
camera
to
a
Major
League
Baseball
game
and
returned
with
24
pictures
of
cloud
formations
.
 
I
had
a
feeling
she
was
just
trying
to
make
me
feel
better
.
 
Then
again
,
to
a
5-year-old
boy
,
finding
a
penny
is
more
exciting
than
seeing
a
squirrel
.
And
why
would
he
waste
good
film
on
something
like
,
say
,
some
endangered
water
buffaloes
,
when
he
could
take
a
picture
of
cool
tennis
shoes
?
Or
his
shiny
new
green
sleeping
bag
?
 
Face
it
:
Things
like
beautiful
sunsets
and
campfires
ca
n't
compare
to
a
bag
of
extra-large
marshmallow
.
 
So
I
did
what
any
good
mother
would
do
:
I
marked
the
date
on
the
back
of
the
pictures
and
slid
them
into
our
family
vacation
photo
album
--
right
after
the
five
pages
of
ice
sculptures
I
took
last
year
on
our
cruise
to
the
Bahamas

"Mr.
Grey
was
the
manager
of
a
small
office
in
London
.
He
lived
in
the
country
,
and
came
to
work
by
train
.
He
liked
walking
from
the
station
to
his
office
if
it
was
not
raining
,
because
it
gave
him
some
exercises
.
One
morning
he
was
walking
along
the
street
when
a
stranger
stopped
him
and
said
to
him
,
""
You
may
not
remember
me
,
sir
,
but
seven
years

I
came
to
London
without

money

I
stopped
you
in
this
street
and
asked
you
to
lend
me
some
money
,
and
you
lent
me
five
pounds
,

you
said
that
you
were
happy
to
take
a
chance
so
as
to
give
a
man
a
start
on
the
road
to
success
.

Mr.

thought
for
a

Yes

I

you

Go

with
your

Well

answered
the

are

willing

take
a
chance

"Fear
and
its
companion
pain
are
two
of
the
most
useful
things
that
men
and
animals
possess
,
if
they
are
properly
used
.
If
fire
did
not
hurt
when
it
burnt
,
children
would
play
with
it
until
their
hands
were
burnt
away
.
Similarly
,
if
pain
existed
but
fear
did
n't
,
a
child
would
burn
himself
or
herself
again
and
again
,
because
fear
would
not
warn
himself
or
herself
to
keep
away
from
the
fire
that
had
burnt
himself
or
herself
before
.
A
really
fearless
soldier
--
and
some
do
exist
,
is
not
a
good
soldier
because
he
is
soon
killed
;
and
a
dead
soldier
is
of
no
use
to
his
army
.
Fear
and
pain
are
therefore
two
guards
without
which
men
and
animals
might
soon
die
out
.
 
In
our
first
sentence
we
suggested
that
fear
should
be
properly
used
.
If
,
for
example
,
you
never
go
out
of
your
house
because
of
the
danger
of
being
knocked
down
and
killed
in
the
street
by
a
car
,
you
are
letting
fear
rule
you
too
much
.
Even
in
your
house
you
are
not
absolutely
safe
:
an
aeroplane
may
crash
on
your
house
,
or
ants
may
eat
away
some
of
the
beams
in
your
roof
so
that
the
latter
falls
on
you
,
or
you
may
get
cancer
!
 
The
important
thing
is
not
to
let
fear
rule
you
,
but
instead
to
use
fear
as
your
servant
and
guide
.
Fear
will
warn
you
of
dangers
;
then
you
have
to
decide
what
action
to
take
.
 
In
many
cases
,
you
can
take
quick
and
successful
action
to
avoid
the
danger
.
For
example
,
you
see
a
car
coming
straight
towards
you
.
Fear
warns
you
,
you
jump
out
of
the
way
,
and
all
is
well
.
 
In
some
cases
,
however
,
you
decide
that
there
is
nothing
that
you
can
do
to
avoid
the
danger
.
For
example
,
you
ca
n't
prevent
an
aeroplane
crashing
onto
your
house
.
In
this
case
,
fear
has
given
you
its
warning
;
you
have
examined
it
and
decided
on
your
course
of
action
,
so
fear
of
this
particular
danger
is
no
longer
of
any
use
to
you
,
and
you
have
to
try
to
overcome
it

"What
's
the
coolest
kind
of
transportation
for
middle
school
students
back
from
winter
holidays
?
A
racing
bike
?
A
car
?
No
,
it
's
a
special
kind
of
shoes
called
Heelys
.
Heelys
look
just
like
common
sports
shoes
,
but
they
have
a
wheel
hidden
in
the
heel
.
So
instead
of
walking
,
kids
can
""
fly
""
around
in
them
.
 
""
Wearing
Heelys
is
fun
and
cool

Wu
Peng
,
a
boy
who
wore
them
on
his
first
day
back
at

Beijing
.
Wu
Peng
said
he
loves
the
shoes
so
much
that
he
wears
them
to
go
here
and
there
.
Sometimes
he
even
follows
his
parents

car
to
the
supermarket
in
his
Heelys
!
 
Other
students
also
think
they
are
very
cool
,
but
some
are
n't
so
lucky
with
their
Heelys
.
It
's
said
that
some
children
fell
down
and
got
hurt
while
wearing
these
shoes
.
 
""
Heelys
wheels
are
in
the
heels

"The
college
entrance
exam
is
not
only
a
big
challenge
for
Chinese
high
school
students
,
but
also
a
very
important
exam
in
the
lives
of
South
Korean
students
.
 
Although
the
long
,
cold
winter
has
already
started
in
South
Korea
,
the
annual
national
exams
have
made
the
atmosphere
very
heated
.
 
More
than
675,000
South
Korean
high
school
graduates
took
the
college
entrance
exam
last
Wednesday
.
They
usually
take
exams
in
Korean
,
maths
,
sociology
,
history
and
foreign
languages
.
 
Officially
there
is
one
college
place
for
every
1.33
students
.
But
because
all
the
students
want
to
go
to
the
top
universities
in
the
country
,
the
competition
can
reach
one
place
for
10
students
.
The
students
want
to
attend
these
colleges
for
both
their
famous
names
and
better
job
opportunities
.
 
Because
students
face
fierce
competition
,
they
have
to
study
very
hard
to
realize
their
dreams
.
Park
Seung
said
he
and
his
classmates
often
go
to
school
before
7:30
a.m.
After
school
has
finished
at
6:30
p.m.
,
most
of
them
go
to
the
library
to
continue
their
study
instead
of
returning
home
.
Since
many
libraries
in
South
Korea
are
open
24
hours
a
day
,
they
often
stay
long
into
the
night
.
Many
of
the
Senior
3
students
only
sleep
for
three
to
four
hours
a
day
.
""
I
feel
a
lot
of
pressure
,
but
I
have
to
study
very
hard
in
order
to
make
my
dream
come
true
.
This
is
my
lifetime
goal
and
it
will
be
a
turning
point
in
my
life
which
could
decide
my
future
,
""
Park
said
.
 
The
exam
day
is
a
very
serious
day
for
the
whole
of
South
Korea
.
Vehicles
are
not
allowed
within
a
200-metre
radius
of
all
the
test
sites
to
make
sure
the
students
have
quiet
surroundings
.
Tooting
of
horns
is
forbidden
,
even
airplanes
are
ordered
to
avoid
landing
and
take-off
near
the
test
sites
during
listening
comprehension
test
hours
.
 
Students
are
told
their
scores
in
December
before
they
apply
for
college
.
This
is
followed
by
face-to-face
oral
tests
.
There
are
public
and
private
universities
in
South
Korea
.
Many
private
universities
are
well-known
,
but
their
fees
can
be
18
,
000
yuan
each
term
.
This
has
made
a
lot
of
students
think
again

"Being
sociable
looks
like
a
good
way
to
add
years
to
your
life
.
Relationships
with
family
,
friends
,
neighbours
,
even
pets
,
will
all
do
the
trick
,
but
the
biggest
longevity
boost
seems
to
come
from
marriage
or
an
equivalent
relationship
.
The
effect
was
first
noted
in
1858
by
William
Fair
,
who
wrote
that
widows
and
widowers
were
at
a
much
higher
risk
of
dying
than
their
married
peers
.
Studies
since
then
suggest
that
marriage
could
and
as
much
as
seven
years
to
a
man
's
life
and
two
to
a
woman
's
.
The
effect
holds
for
all
rouses
of
death
,
whether
illness
,
accident
or
self-harm
.
 
Even
if
the
odds
are
stacked
against
you
,
marriage
can
more
than
compensate
.
Linda
Waite
from
the
University
of
Chicago
has
found
that
.
I
married
older
man
with
heart
disease
can
expect
to
live
nearly
four
years
longer
than
an
unmarried
man
with
a
healthy
heart
.
Likewise
,
a
married
man
who
smokes
more
than
a
pack
a
day
is
likely
to
live
as
long
as
a
divorced
man
who
does
n't
smoke
.
There
's
a
flip
side
,
however
,
as
partners
are
more
likely
to
become
ill
or
die
in
the
couple
of
years
following
their
spouse
's
death
,
and
caring
for
a
spouse
with
mental
disorder
can
leave
you
with
some
of
the
same
severe
problems
.
 
Even
so
,
the
odds
favour
marriage
.
In
a
30
-
year
study
of
more
than
10,000
people
,
Nicholas
Christakis
of
Harvard
Medical
School
describes
how
all
kinds
of
social
networks
have
similar
effects
.
 
So
how
does
it
work
?
The
effects
are
complex
,
affected
by
socio
-
economic
factors
,
health
-
service
provision
,
emotional
support
and
other
more
physiological
mechanisms
.
For
example
,
social
contact
can
boost
development
of
die
brain
and
immune
system
,
leading
to
better
health
and
less
chance
of
depression
?
later
in
life
.
People
in
supportive
relationships
may
handle
stress
better
.
Then
there
are
the
psychological
9
benefits
of
a
supportive
partner
.
 
A
life
partner
,
children
and
good
friends
arc
all
recommended
if
you
aim
to
live
to
100
.
The
ultimate
social
network
is
still
being
mapped
out
,
hut
Christakis
says
:
""
People
are
interconnected
,
so
their
health
 
is
interconnected

"A
new
international
study
shows
that
some
people
's
biological
clock
plays
a
powerful
role
for
their
life
expectancy
,
regardless
of
lifestyle
choices
.
 
Published
in
the
latest
issue
ofAgingon
Wednesday
,
the
study
has
found
the
most
definitive
evidence
to
explain
why
some
people
keep
healthy
lifestyle
but
die
younger
than
others
.
 
Geneticist
Steve
Horvath
from
the
University
of
California
,
Los
Angeles
(
UCLA
)
,
led
a
team
of
65
scientists
around
the
world
to
record
age-related
changes
to
human
DNA
,
analyse
blood
samples
collected
from
13
,
000
people
and
estimate
their
lifespan
.
 
A
higher
biological
age
,
regardless
of
actual
age
,
consistently
predicts
an
earlier
death
,
the
study
says
.
 
""
You
get
people
who
are
vegan
,
sleep
10
hours
a
day
,
have
a
low-stress
job
,
and
still
end
up
dying
young
,
""
Horvath
said
in
a
statement
.
""
We
have
shown
some
people
have
a
faster
innate
aging
rate
.
""
 
The
findings
discovered
that
5
percent
of
the
population
ages
at
a
faster
biological
rate
,
which
translated
to
a
roughly
50
percent
higher
than
average
risk
of
death
at
any
age
.
 
""
The
great
hope
is
that
we
find
anti-aging
interventions
that
would
slow
your
innate
aging
rate
,
""
Horvath
said
,
adding
that
""
this
is
an
important
milestone
to
realizing
this
dream

"From
self-driving
cars
to
carebots
(
care+robots
)
for
elderly
people
,
rapid
development
in
technology
has
long
represented
a
possible
threat
to
many
jobs
normally
performed
by
people
.
But
experts
now
believe
that
almost
50
percent
of
occupations
existing
today
will
be
completely
unnecessary
by
2025
as
artificial
intelligence
continues
to
change
businesses
.
 
""
The
next
fifteen
years
will
see
a
revolution
in
how
we
work
,
and
a
revolution
will
necessarily
take
place
in
how
we
plan
and
think
about
workplaces
,
""
said
Peter
Andrew
,
Director
of
Workplace
Strategy
for
CBRE
Asia
Pacific
.
 
A
growing
number
of
jobs
in
the
future
will
require
creative
intelligence
,
social
skills
and
the
ability
to
use
artificial
intelligence
.
 
The
report
is
based
on
interviews
with
200
experts
,
business
leaders
and
young
people
from
Asia
Pacific
,
Europe
and
North
America
.
It
shows
that
in
the
US
technology
already
destroys
more
jobs
than
it
creates
.
 
But
the
report
states
:
""
Losing
occupations
does
not
necessarily
mean
losing
jobs
--
just
changing
what
people
do
.
""
Growth
in
new
jobs
could
occur
as
much
,
according
to
the
research
.
 
""
The
growth
of
20
to
40
person
companies
that
have
the
speed
and
technological
know-how
will
directly
challenge
big
companies
,
""
it
states
.
 
A
2014
report
by
Pew
Research
found
52
percent
of
experts
in
artificial
intelligence
and
robotics
were
optimistic
about
the
future
and
believed
there
would
still
be
enough
jobs
in
the
next
few
years
.
The
optimists
pictured
""
a
future
in
which
robots
do
not
take
the
place
of
more
jobs
than
they
create
,
""
according
to
Aaron
Smith
,
the
report
's
co-author
.
 
""
Technology
will
continue
to
affect
jobs
,
but
more
jobs
seem
likely
to
be
created
.
Although
there
have
always
been
unemployed
people
,
when
we
reached
a
few
billion
people
there
were
billions
of
jobs
.
There
is
no
shortage
of
things
that
need
to
be
done
and
that
will
not
change

"Do
you
want
to
be
productive
at
work
or
at
home
?
Here
's
what
you
should
do
.
 
1
.
Cut
off
television
 
I
used
to
tell
myself
that
I
needed
a
break
.
So
,
when
the
kids
slept
I
turned
on
the
cable
and
watched
whatever
program
that
caught
my
fancy
.
Often
,
I
found
myself
not
watching
,
just
channel-surfing
.
And
I
did
n't
end
up
watching
a
full
program
.
I
decided
one
day
to
just
give
up
on
TV
as
it
made
me
sleep
late
and
woke
up
tired
.
 
If
you
want
to
be
productive
,
cut
off
TV
.
You
are
better
off
reading
a
book
.
Without
TV
,
I
have
managed
to
finish
many
books
which
I
have
bought
but
never
read
.
 
2
.
Limit
Internet
use
 
The
other
big
distraction
that
can
make
you
sleep
late
is
the
Internet
.
Probably
because
you
will
be
checking
your
emails
,
updating
your
blog
,
watching
YouTube
,
etc
.
Try
limiting
the
use
of
it
at
home
,
or
switch
it
to
the
morning
session
.
 
Nowadays
,
I
check
all
my
personal
emails
early
in
the
morning
.
When
I
get
into
work
,
I
find
myself
less
tempted
to
check
personal
emails
.
 
3
.
Know
your
priorities
 
Really
,
it
is
all
about
the
choices
you
make
and
the
priorities
you
have
.
If
you
know
it
is
competitive
out
there
in
the
world
,
how
can
you
be
a
better
worker
than
the
person
who
is
also
aiming
for
the
position
above
you
?
 
4
.
Rest
early
,
rise
early
 
Do
you
want
to
be
productive
?
Rise
early
,
read
more
books
,
have
more
energy
,
be
more
focused
and
set
standards
for
others
to
catch
up
.
It
's
as
simple
as
that

"Every
year
in
the
first
week
of
English
class
,
some
students
inform
me
that
writing
is
too
hard
.
They
never
write
,
unless
homework
requires
it
.
They
find
the
writing
process
painful
and
difficult
.
 
How
awful
it
is
to
be
able
to
speak
in
a
language
but
not
to
write
in
it
,
especially
with
its
rich
vocabulary
.
Being
able
to
speak
but
not
write
is
like
living
in
an
enormous
mansion
and
never
leaving
one
small
room
.
When
I
meet
students
who
think
they
ca
n't
write
,
I
know
,
as
a
teacher
my
duty
is
to
show
them
the
rest
of
the
rooms
.
My
task
is
to
build
fluency
and
accuracy
while
providing
the
opportunity
in
any
writing
activity
to
enhance
the
moral
and
emotional
development
of
my
students
.
 
One
great
way
to
do
this
is
by
having
students
write
in
a
journal
in
class
every
day
.
 
Writing
ability
is
like
strength
training
.
Writing
needs
to
be
done
just
like
exercise
;
just
as
muscles
grow
stronger
with
exercise
,
writing
skills
improve
quickly
with
writing
practice
daily
.
I
often
see
a
rise
in
student
confidence
and
performance
after
only
a
few
weeks
of
journal
writing
.
 
Expressing
oneself
in
writing
is
one
of
the
most
important
skills
I
teach
to
strengthen
the
whole
students
.
When
my
students
practice
journal
writing
,
they
are
practicing
for
their
future
academic
,
political
,
and
emotional
lives
.
They
build
skills
so
that
some
say
they
might
write
a
great
novel
,
a
piece
of
sorely
needed
legislation
,
or
the
perfect
love
letter
.
That
they
write
in
their
journals
every
day
puts
them
a
step
closer
to
fluency
,
eloquence
and
command
of
the
language

"As
many
as
10
of
the
17
kinds
of
penguins
may
be
in
danger
of
disappearing
.
The
number
of
penguins
have
decreased
by
30
%
since
1987
.
 
Penguins
are
black
and
white
birds
that
live
in
the
southern
part
of
the
world
.
They
are
common
in
South
America
,
New
Zealand
,
Australia
and
South
Africa
.
Many
live
near
cold
waters
.
But
some
live
near
warm
waters
in
Galapagos
Islands
.
Penguins
can
not
fly
,
but
they
are
fine
swimmers
.
Penguins
eat
fish
and
krill
.
 
The
warming
of
the
earth
is
the
decrease
in
penguin
populations
.
The
heating
of
the
air
has
caused
ocean
waters
to
become
warmer
.
Higher
water
temperatures
have
reduced
the
supply
of
fish
and
krill
.
Some
years
later
these
birds
are
completely
unable
to
reproduce
.
Besides
,
many
adult
penguins
die
of
hunger
.
 
Widespread
fishing
,
exploration
for
oil
and
oil
leaks
also
make
penguins
be
in
danger
.
Poisonous
organisms
in
ocean
water
are
another
danger
.
Penguins
also
have
their
enemies
,
including
wild
dogs
,
sharks
,
seals
and
sea
lions
.
 
News
about
penguins
is
not
all
bad
,
however
.
Several
years
ago
,
oil
leaking
from
a
ship
hurt
40
%
of
the
penguins
in
South
Africa
.
The
penguins
became
covered
with
oil
.
But
thousands
of
people
helped
clean
and
treat
the
birds
well
.
Then
they
returned
the
penguins
to
the
wild
.
Now
these
South
African
penguins
are
reproducing
in
higher
numbers
than
before
the
oil
leaking
."	"269

"A
nameless
British
millionaire
is
currently
putting
people
to
the
test
by
handing
out
PS1,000
to
those
he
randomly
meets
in
the
street
.
All
he
'd
ask
is
that
they
'd
do
something
positive
with
the
cash
.
The
reactions
are
varied
,
from
the
surprised
to
the
suspicious
to
the
simply
delighted
.
He
has
given
away
close
to
PS100,000
to
people
he
has
met
around
the
world
.
He
hands
those
that
he
chooses
a
card
explaining
his
project
and
allows
them
48
hours
to
get
in
touch
.
 
""
Mr.
Lucky
""
is
from
London
,
in
his
late
thirties
and
appears
wearing
rolled-up
jeans
and
with
a
camera
around
his
neck
.
Working
for
an
insurance
company
abroad
,
he
earned
his
fortune
and
resigned
last
year
after
having
realized
he
had
more
money
than
he
knew
what
to
do
with
.
 
""
I
once
booked
myself
a
flight
into
space
;
I
thought
I
'd
fulfill
my
childhood
dream
.
Then
I
told
my
friends
and
when
the
conversation
changed
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
had
that
amount
of
money
,
I
felt
embarrassed
.
Their
ideas
were
much
more
generous
,
interesting
and
responsible
than
mine
,
""
said
Mr.
Lucky
.
After
canceling
his
space
flight
and
struggling
to
choose
a
worthy
cause
for
his
cash
,
he
decided
to
set
up
the
WeAreLucky
project
.
""
I
did
n't
want
to
just
pass
on
my
luck
;
I
also
wanted
to
share
the
responsibility
.
I
decided
to
give
away
PS1,000
every
day
.
I
'd
asked
the
receivers
to
fill
in
a
brief
questionnaire
to
explain
their
intentions
in
using
the
money
.
""
 
But
is
handing
over
the
responsibility
to
others
really
a
responsible
thing
to
do
?
How
does
he
know
the
money
will
be
used
properly
?
""
I
'm
not
going
to
judge
or
start
checking
up
on
them
.
Sometimes
what
we
need
to
do
is
just
believing
others
,

with
nearly
childlike
enthusiasm

"Who
is
more
stressed
out
--
the
Asian
teenager
or
the
American
teenager
?
Surprise
!
The
American
teen
wins
this
match
.
According
to
a
recent
study
,
almost
three
quarters
of
American
high
school
students
said
they
felt
stress
at
least
once
a
week
,
some
almost
every
day
.
Fewer
than
half
of
Japanese
and
Taiwanese
eleventh
grade
students
reported
feeling
stress
that
often
.
 
The
phenomenon
of
stress
is
the
constant
interaction
between
mind
and
body
.
And
the
influence
of
one
upon
the
other
can
be
either
positive
or
negative
.
What
can
the
mind
do
to
the
body
?
Studies
have
proved
that
watching
funny
movies
can
reduce
pain
and
promote
healing
.
On
the
contrary
worry
can
give
a
person
an
ulcer
,
high
blood
pressure
,
or
even
a
heart
attack
.
 
The
mind
and
body
work
together
to
produce
stress
,
which
is
a
response
to
a
stimulus
,
a
response
that
disturbs
the
body
's
normal
physiological
balance
.
However
,
stress
is
not
always
bad
.
For
example
,
a
stress
reaction
can
sometimes
save
a
person
's
life
by
producing
hormones
that
make
it
possible
for
a
person
to
react
quickly
and
with
greater
energy
in
a
dangerous
situation
.
In
everyday
situations
,
too
,
stress
can
provide
that
extra
push
needed
to
do
something
difficult
.
But
too
much
stress
often
injures
both
the
mind
and
the
body
.
How
can
stress
be
kept
under
control
?

in

"Usually
,
students
are
not
encouraged
to
run
or
jump
around
in
the
corridor
.
However
,
students
in
a
British
grammar
school
really
enjoy
running
on
the
corridor
tiles
and
their
teachers
even
encourage
them
to
do
that
.
 
Why
?
It
is
because
the
corridor
was
built
with
special
kinetic
tiles
.
When
students
jump
on
the
tiles
,
electricity
will
be
produced
.
After
one
year
,
the
electricity
produced
from
the
tiles
can
fully
charge
853
mobile
phones
or
power
an
electric
car
to
drive
seven
miles
.
It
's
amazing
,
is
n't
it
?
 
The
corridor
tiles
are
really
a
brilliant
invention
.
Students
can
not
only
play
on
the
corridor
,
but
also
help
power
the
lights
in
their
school
corridors
and
other
equipment
in
their
classrooms
.
Besides
,
this
is
a
good
way
to
teach
students
to
be
creative
.
They
will
be
inspired
to
be
scientists
,
inventors
and
engineers
in
the
future
to
find
clean
energy
for
all
humans
.
 
The
inventor
of
the
magic
corridor
tiles
is
Laurence
Kemball-Cook
.
He
was
once
a
student
in
this
school
.
Now
,
he
is
CEO
of
his
own
company
.
The
corridor
tiles
are
not
Laurence
's
only
invention
.
He
has
also
invented
a
special
dance
floor
,
which
can
be
used
at
music
festivals
.
It
allows
dancers
to
charge
their
mobile
phones
while
they
are
dancing
on
the
dance
floor

"Try
imagining
what
the
world
will
be
like
in
the
year
3000
.
Some
serious
thinkers
are
starting
to
imagine
just
that
.
 
Bart
:
I
do
n't
know
that
present-day
electronic
chips
are
,
but
some
sort
of
chips
--
I
'd
guess
maybe
plastic
.
Our
three-pound
brain
is
definitely
a
wonder
,
perhaps
the
greatest
wonder
of
natural
biology
.
In
this
coming
century
,
we
'll
be
re-engineering
the
brain
a
piece
at
a
time
,
first
with
implants
and
finally
engineering
an
complete
replacement
.
There
's
no
question
that
in
the
distant
future
we
'll
play
the
music
of
the
mind
on
instruments
different
from
the
current
ones
.
So
,
yes
,
chips
are
our
destiny
.
 
Edward
:
In
3000
perhaps
the
biggest
difference
from
today
is
that
there
will
be
no
more
men
.
Females
can
have
female
children
,
without
any
need
for
men
.
In
about
ten
years
,
we
'll
find
the
cocktail
that
women
can
take
to
have
female
children
.
There
'll
be
no
need
for
men
at
all
.
 
Greg
:
What
is
Heaven
?
Heaven
's
a
place
where
you
can
create
worlds
at
will
,
and
the
ideal
Heaven
is
where
you
run
the
whole
thing
yourself
.
The
current
means
of
getting
to
Heaven
involve
various
supernatural
systems
for
which
,
at
this
point
,
there
's
no
scientific
evidence
.
So
I
think
we
can
reduce
Heaven
to
an
engineering
project
which
we
're
doing
.
The
demand
for
Heaven
is
great
--
witness
the
desire
of
every
human
heart
,
from
the
people
who
built
the
ancient
pyramids
to
modern
society
,
to
live
beyond
one
's
given
time
.
Our
plan
is
to
change
human
consciousness
from
the
brain
to
bits
of
information
in
a
computer
chip
,
or
some
other
kind
of
computational
medium
,
so
that
just
by
thinking
we
'll
be
able
to
create
our
own
personal
world
.
And
I
think
the
first
stage
of
Heaven
will
be
the
feeling
world
,
and
beyond
that
I
think
we
'd
find
a
higher
,
more
spiritual
plane

"Kitesurfing
as
a
water
sport
began
in
the
1980s
,
but
did
n't
get
popular
until
the
end
of
last
century
.
It
is
also
known
as
kiteboarding
,
and
in
some
European
countries
as
flysurfing
.
Kitesurfing
works
through
wind
power
by
using
a
large
kite
to
pull
a
rider
on
the
water
at
high
speed
.
 
At
first
,
kitesurfing
was
a
difficult
and
dangerous
sport
.
Now
it
is
becoming
easier
and
safer
because
of
the
safer
kite
design
.
For
an
able
and
strong
person
,
kitesurfing
can
be
a
very
fun
,
extremely
exciting
sport
,
just
like
skating
on
the
water
with
a
feeling
of
flying
.
It
has
become
more
and
more
popular
.
 
Compared
with
other
water
sports
,
kitesurfing
is
easier
to
learn
.
A
beginner
can
understand
how
to
operate
the
kite
with
5
--
10
hours
of
training
.
And
anybody
aged
from
13
to
65
can
learn
.
It
is
not
expensive
to
get
the
equipment
for
kitesurfing
,
which
costs
$
1,000
to
82,500
.
Training
lessons
range
from
$
200
to
$
500
for
two
or
three
hours
.
With
the
development
of
its
equipment
progress
,
kitesurfing
is
becoming
even
safer
.
After
some
training
,
you
can
enjoy
its
excitement
and
challenging
feeling
.
 
With
the
rising
popularity
of
kitesurfing
,
most
major
seaside
cities
have
kitesurfing
clubs
.
In
China
,
Xiamen
is
the
only
place
that
has
the
kitesurfing
club
,
which
provides
professional
kitesurfing
training
and
equipments

""
When
we
realized
that
students
really
actually
want
to
have
a
purpose
for
what
they
're
creating
,
we
introduced
the
idea
of
inspiring
them
with
the
UN
Millennium
Development
Goals
and
suggesting
that
they
use
those
for
their
muse
.
""
This
past
year
we
also
rolled
out
something
called
the
Imagine
Cup
Solve
This
library
,
where
IGOs
,
NGOs
and
nonprofits
can
submit
some
of
the
technical
challenges
that
they
would
like
students
to
consider
for
their
solutions
.
""
 
Microsoft
says
over
350,000
high
school
and
college
students
registered
for
this
year
's
competition
.
Judges
chose
more
than
four
hundred
of
them
to
attend
the
finals
.
 
SUZI
LEVINE
:
""
One
from
Thailand
was
called
NewKrean
,
where
they
created
a
Windows
Phone
7
application
that
allows
you
to
broadcast
your
location
to
your
social
network
of
friends
so
that
you
can
be
more
easily
rescued
.
""
They
named
their
application
Terra
.
 
Suzi
Levine
says
there
were
also
ideas
from
Egypt
inspired
by
the
revolution
that
overthrew
president
Hosni
Mubarak
in
February
.
 
SUZI
LEVINE
:
""
One
was
to
use
Bluetooth
as
sort
of
a
Twitter
equivalent
so
that
if
the
government
shuts
down
the
Internet
,
you
actually
can
still
have
a
massive
social
distribution
.
""
 
Students
competed
in
nine
categories
.
For
example
,
in
software
design
the
top
prize
of
twenty-five
thousand
dollars
went
to
Team
Hermes
from
Ireland
.
The
students
developed
a
device
for
cars
to
collect
information
on
road
conditions
,
driving
behavior
and
traffic
incidents
.
 
A
team
from
Taiwan
's
National
Tsing
Hua
University
won
first
place
in
the
embedded
development
category
.
They
developed
a
network
of
wireless
devices
to
help
plot
the
safest
escape
routes
during
a
fire
.
 
Next
year
's
awards
ceremony
will
take
place
in
Australia
.
Registration
for
Imagine
Cup
twenty-twelve
opened
Friday
.
Also
,
Microsoft
announced
plans
for
a
three
million
dollar
program
to
help
Imagine

"When
15-year-old
Louisa
Ball
takes
a
nap
,
she
sleeps
for
days
on
end
,
and
no
amount
of
shaking
can
fully
wake
her
up
.
The
British
girl
has
a
rare
condition
called
Sleeping
Beauty
Sickness
.
Doctors
do
n't
know
what
causes
it
or
how
to
cure
it
--
only
know
that
it
strikes
teenagers
and
goes
away
by
itself
after
eight
to
12
years
.
 
Louisa
's
mum
,
Lottie
,
told
NBC
News
that
the
girl
had
flulike
symptoms
just
over
a
year
ago
.
Shortly
afterward
,
she
had
her
first
period
of
long
sleeping
.
 
She
was
eventually
diagnosed
with
Kleine-Levin
Syndrome
,
whose
victims
worldwide
may
number
no
more
than
1,000
.
The
victims
live
normally
for
weeks
or
months
at
a
time
,
with
normal
sleep
patterns
and
normal
energy
levels
.
Then
,
with
little
warning
,
they
'll
go
to
sleep
for
days
or
weeks
at
a
time
.
So
far
,
Louisa
's
longest
period
in
bed
has
been
13
days
.
Victims
will
wake
briefly
,
but
be
disoriented
and
not
fully
awake
.
Louisa
's
parents
force
her
awake
so
she
can
use
the
bathroom
and
eat
.
 
Now
,
Louisa
's
friends
can
tell
when
a
period
is
coming
on
.
She
stops
talking
and
she
may
be
annoyed
easily
.
That
's
when
she
knows
she
has
to
get
home
to
her
bed
.
Louisa
has
slept
through
family
vacations
,
the
dance
recitals
she
loves
to
perform
in
,
and
school
tests
.
Now
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
to
catch
up
on
missed
schoolwork
.
 
But
just
as
doctors
do
n't
know
the
cause
,
they
also
do
n't
know
why
it
ends
as
mysteriously
as
it
began
.
The
illness
is
unrelated
to
narcolepsy
,
whose
victims
are
constantly
tired
and
drop
off
for
brief
periods
of
sleep
at
any
time
.
 
It
's
so
dramatic
that
some
people
have
accused
Louisa
of
making
the
false
symptoms
to
get
attention
.
Her
father
,
Richard
,
thinks
that
's
absurd

"Roosegaarde
,
an
artist
and
designer
from
Dutch
has
thought
of
a
device
.
He
hopes
it
will
make
Beijing
's
sky
clear
again
and
help
the
people
with
masks
breathe
fresh
air
again
in
Beijing
.
 
An
electromagnetic
field
will
pull
the
dirty
particles
in
the
air
to
the
ground
,
and
then
they
can
be
easily
cleaned
.
 
Roosegaarde
says
,
""
It
's
like
when
you
have
a
balloon
which
has
static
electricity
and
your
hair
goes
toward
it
.
Smog
happens
the
same
way
as
the
hair
.
""
 
His
workplace
has
reached
an
agreement
with
the
Beijing
government
to
test
the
technology
in
one
of
the
capital
's
parks
.
Beijing
's
skies
are
regularly
covered
by
grey
smog
.
Serious
cases
of
air
pollution
are
often
reported
in
Beijing
.
Roosegaarde
says
an
indoor
test
has
already
shown
it
works
well
and
he
is
confident
of
the
results
.
With
the
help
of
a
team
of
scientists
and
engineers
,
he
is
sure
that
the
device
can
be
worked
outside
.
 
""
Beijing
is
a
very
good
place
to
test
the
device
because
the
smog
in
Beijing
is
quite
low
and
there
's
not
so
much
wind
.
""
says
Roosegaarde
.
""
We
'll
be
able
to
make
the
air
pure
but
the
most
difficult
thing
is
to
remove
the
smog
.
As
a
result
,
you
can
see
the
sun
again
.
""
 
Roosegaarde
also
reminds
us
that
his
aim
is
not
only
to
give
a
plan
to
solve
Beijing
's
dirty
air
pollution
but
also
to
make
people
pay
attention
to
the
environment
problem
.
He
adds
,
""
This
is
not
the
real
answer
for
smog
.
The
real
answer
to
do
with
it
is
clean
cars
,
different
industry
and
different
lifestyles
.
""
However
,
he
hopes
the
project
will
make
the
citizens
realize
the
differences
between
clean
air
and
smog-filled
air
."	"1

"A
story
is
told
about
a
soldier
who
was
finally
coming
home
after
having
fought
in
Vietnam
.
He
called
his
parents
from
San
Francisco
.
 
""
Mom
and
Dad
,
I
'm
coming
home
,
but
I
have
a
friend
I
'd
like
to
bring
with
me
.
""
 
""
Sure
,
""
they
replied
,
""
we
'd
love
to
meet
him
.
""
 
""
There
is
something
you
should
know
,
""
the
son
continued
,
""
he
was
hurt
badly
in
the
fighting
.
He
lost
an
arm
and
a
leg
.
He
has
nowhere
else
to
go
,
and
I
want
him
to
live
with
us
.
""
 
""
I
'm
sorry
to
hear
that
,
son
.
Maybe
we
can
help
him
find
somewhere
to
live
.
""
 
""
No
,
Mom
and
Dad
,
I
want
him
to
live
with
us
.
""
 
""
Son
,
""
said
the
father
,
""
you
do
n't
know
what
you
're
asking
.
Someone
like
the
young
man
would
be
a
terrible
burden
for
us
.
We
have
our
own
lives
to
live
,
and
we
ca
n't
let
something
like
this
stay
with
our
lives
.
I
think
you
should
just
come
home
and
forget
about
this
guy
.
He
'll
find
a
way
to
live
on
his
own
.
""
 
At
that
point
,
the
son
hung
up
the
phone
.
A
few
days
later
,
however
,
they
received
a
call
from
the
San
Francisco
police
.
Their
son
had
died
after
falling
down
from
a
building
.
The
police
believed
it
was
suicide
.
 
The
parents
flew
to
San
Francisco
.
To
their
surprise
,
they
found
their
son
had
only
one
arm
and
one
leg
.
 
The
parents
in
this
story
are
like
many
of
us
.
We
find
it
easy
to
love
those
who
are
good-looking
or
fun
,
but
we
do
n't
like
people
who
make
us
feel
uncomfortable
.
We
would
rather
stay
away
from
people
who
are
n't
as
healthy
,
beautiful
,
or
smart
as
we
are

"Dear
Editor
,
 
I
used
to
be
a
doctor
in
the
children
's
department
of
a
hospital
.
Sometimes
I
treated
children
who
had
been
poisoned
by
medicine
for
older
family
members
.
The
children
did
n't
know
the
medicine
was
dangerous
;
they
just
knew
it
tasted
sweet
.
Children
easily
open
the
bottle
that
we
now
use
in
China
.
 
Some
days
ago
I
talked
about
medicines
with
an
American
.
He
showed
me
a
sort
of
plastic
bottle
.
The
design
was
quite
simple
and
I
'm
sure
our
Chinese
factories
could
produce
these
bottles
.
The
top
of
the
bottle
licks
but
can
be
opened
by
pressing
down
on
it
while
turning
.
This
is
difficult
for
most
young
children
to
do
,
though
grown-ups
can
open
these
bottles
very
easily
.
 
I
'm
certain
that
the
expense
of
making
such
tops
would
be
very
small
.
As
a
doctor
,
I
'd
love
to
see
this
done
.
And
most
parents
would
be
grateful
.
 
Sincerely
yours
,
 
Li
Hua"	"1

"Long
,
long
ago
there
were
a
lot
of
donkeys
.
The
donkeys
worked
hard
every
day
.
They
had
no
time
to
play
or
to
relax
,
but
they
never
felt
appreciated
for
the
work
they
did
.
 
One
day
two
donkeys
got
bored
.
They
wanted
to
live
a
comfortable
life
.
So
the
donkeys
went
to
see
a
wise
old
man
.
They
told
him
their
problem
.
The
wise
old
man
agreed
that
they
worked
too
hard
,
and
he
wanted
to
help
the
donkeys
.
""
I
have
an
idea
.
""
he
said
.
 
""
What
is
your
idea
?
""
asked
the
donkeys
.
 
""
I
will
paint
you
and
no
one
will
know
you
are
donkeys
,
""
said
the
man
.
 
The
man
went
off
to
find
some
paint
and
he
returned
in
just
a
matter
of
minutes
.
He
had
two
pots
of
paint
.
One
pot
was
filled
with
white
paint
,
and
the
other
black
paint
.
 
The
old
man
first
painted
them
white
,
and
then
painted
black
stripes
over
the
white
paint
.
When
he
finished
,
the
donkeys
did
not
look
at
all
like
donkeys
.
""
You
no
longer
look
like
donkeys
,
""
the
old
man
said
.
""
Everyone
will
be
fooled
.
I
will
call
you
something
else
,
zebras
.
""
 
The
zebras
went
to
a
field
to
eat
grass
.
Now
they
did
not
have
to
work
.
 
Soon
,
other
donkeys
saw
the
zebras
.
They
asked
the
zebras
where
they
came
from
.
When
the
'
zebras
told
the
donkeys
their
secret
,
the
donkeys
all
rushed
to
see
the
old
man
.
 
""
Make
us
into
zebras
,
too
,
""
they
pleaded
.
So
the
wise
old
man
painted
more
donkeys
.
As
he
did
,
more
and
more
donkeys
came
.
 
The
old
man
could
not
paint
fast
enough
.
Soon
the
donkeys
became
impatient
.
They
began
to
kick
about
,
and
they
knocked
over
the
paint
pots
.
 
There
was
no
more
paint
.
The
painted
donkeys
ran
off
to
become
zebras
.
The
unpainted
don-
keys
,
because
of
their
impatience
,
had
to
return
to
work
.
 
This
is
,
why
it
is
important
to
be
patient

"In
Egyptian
myth
,
Apophis
was
the
ancient
spirit
of
evil
and
destruction
,
a
demon
that
was
determined
to
throw
the
world
into
darkness
forever
.
A
fitting
name
,
astronomers
reasoned
,
for
a
threat
now
rushing
towards
Earth
from
outer
space
.
Scientists
are
monitoring
the
progress
of
a
390-metere
wide
asteroid
discovered
last
year
,
which
is
potentially
on
a
collision
course
with
the
planet
.
 
NASA
has
estimated
that
Apophis
has
an
outside
chance
of
hitting
the
Earth
in
2036
.
If
it
did
hit
us
,
thousands
of
square
kilometers
would
be
directly
affected
by
the
explosion
but
the
whole
of
the
Earth
would
see
the
effects
of
the
dust
sent
into
the
atmosphere
.
At
a
recent
meeting
of
experts
in
Near-Earth
objects
(
NEOs
)
in
London
,
scientists
said
it
could
take
decades
to
design
,
test
and
build
the
required
technology
to
deflect
the
asteroid
.
 
The
Apophis
asteroid
is
placed
at
four
out
of
ten
on
the
Torino
scale
--
a
measure
of
the
threat
caused
by
an
NEO
where
10
is
a
certain
collision
which
could
cause
a
global
disaster
.
This
is
the
most
possible
danger
of
any
asteroid
in
recorded
history
and
it
has
a
1
in
37
chance
of
hitting
the
Earth
.
 
Alan
Fitzsimmons
,
an
astronomer
from
Queen
's
University
Belfast
,
said
,
""
When
it
does
pass
close
to
us
on
April
13
,
2029
,
the
Earth
will
deflect
it
and
change
its
orbit
.
There
is
a
small
possibility
that
if
it
passes
through
a
particular
point
in
space
,
the
so-called
keyhole
,
the
Earth
's
gravity
will
change
things
so
that
when
it
comes
back
around
again
in
2036
,
it
will
collide
with
us
.
""
The
chance
of
Apophis
passing
through
the
keyhole
,
a
600-meter
patch
of
space
,
is
1
in
5,500
,
based
on
current
information
.
 
There
is
no
shortage
of
ideas
on
how
to
deflect
asteroids
.
The
Advanced
Concepts
Team
at
the
European
Space
Agency
has
led
the
effort
in
designing
a
range
of
satellites
and
rockets
to
nudge
asteroids
that
are
on
a
collision
course
for
Earth
into
a
different
orbit

"When
people
talk
about
air
pollution
,
they
usually
think
of
smog
,
acid
rain
,
and
other
forms
of
outdoor
air
pollution
.
But
did
you
know
that
air
pollution
also
is
inside
homes
,
offices
,
hotels
and
other
buildings
?
Indoor
air
pollution
is
more
serious
.
The
air
in
your
home
can
be
2
to
100
times
more
polluted
than
the
air
outdoors
!
In
fact
,
some
American
doctors
say
that
50
%
of
illnesses
have
something
to
do
with
polluted
indoor
air
.
Indoor
air
pollution
is
bad
for
our
health
in
many
ways
.
Young
children
and
the
old
often
suffer
more
from
air
pollution
.
People
with
health
problems
may
also
suffer
more
when
the
air
is
polluted
.
Indoor
air
pollution
can
be
bad
for
people
's
eyes
,
nose
and
throat
.
Air
pollution
,
both
indoor
and
outdoor
,
can
also
lead
to
cancer
,
heart
disease
,
and
even
bad
for
the
brain
!
In
the
great
London
fog
in
1952
,
4,000
people
died
in
a
few
days
because
of
air
pollution
!
It
is
said
that
half
a
million
young
kids
and
women
die
each
year
in
India
because
of
indoor
air
pollution
!
 
There
're
many
ways
to
reduce
indoor
air
pollution
.
Here
are
some
of
them
and
see
if
they
can
help
you
:
 
Increase
outdoor
air
coming
indoors
and
open
your
windows
for
15
to
30
minutes
each
day
.
 
Turn
off
all
the
lights
and
fans
when
you
do
n't
need
them
.
 
Share
your
room
with
others
when
the
air
conditioner
is
running
.
 
Do
n't
smoke
and
try
to
stop
your
family
members
from
smoking
.
People
who
smoke
are
going
to
have
trouble
breathing
and
even
die
someday
.
If
you
're
smart
,
do
n't
ever
start
.
 
Environment-friendly
products
,
such
as
water-based
paints
pollute
less
and
work
well

To
be
or
not
to
be
.
""
Outside
the
Bible
,
these
six
words
are
the
most
famous
in
all
the
literature
of
the
world
.
They
were
spoken
by
Hamlet
when
he
was
thinking
aloud
,
and
they
are
the
most
famous
words
in
Shakespeare
because
Hamlet
was
speaking
not
only
for
himself
but
also
for
every
thinking
man
and
woman
.
To
be
or
not
to
be
,
to
live
or
not
to
live
,
to
live
richly
and
abundantly
,
or
to
live
dully
and
meanly
.
A
philosopher
once
wanted
to
know
whether
he
was
alive
or
not
,
which
is
a
good
question
for
everyone
to
put
to
himself
occasionally
.
He
answered
it
by
saying
:
""
I
think
,
therefore
I
am
.
""
 
But
the
best
definition
of
existence
I
ever
saw
was
one
written
by
another
philosopher
who
said
:
""
To
be
is
to
be
in
relations
.
""
If
this
is
true
,
then
the
more
relations
a
living
thing
has
,
the
more
it
is
alive
.
To
live
abundantly
means
simply
to
increase
the
range
and
intensity
of
our
relations
.
Unfortunately
we
are
so
constituted
that
we
get
to
love
our
routine
.
But
other
than
our
regular
occupation
,
how
much
are
we
alive
?
If
you
are
interested
only
in
your
regular
occupation
,
you
are
alive
only
to
that
extent
.
So
far
as
other
things
are
concerned
--
-
poetry
and
prose
,
music
,
pictures
,
sports
,
unselfish
friendships
,
politics
,
international
affairs
--
-you
are
dead
.
 
On
the
contrary
,
it
is
true
that
every
time
you
acquire
a
new
interest
--
-
even
more
,
a
new
accomplishment
--
-
you
increase
your
power
of
life
.
No
one
who
is
deeply
interested
in
different
kinds
of
subjects
can
remain
unhappy
.
The
real
""
pessimist
""
is
the
person
who
has
lost
interest
.
 
Bacon
said
that
a
man
dies
as
often
as
he
loses
a
friend
.
But
we
gain
new
life
by
contacts
with
new
friends
,
and
new
ideas
and
thoughts
,
too
.
Where
your
thoughts
are
,
there
will
be
your
life
too
.
If
your
thoughts
are
limited
only
to
your
business
,
only
to
your
physical
welfare
,
only
to
your
narrow
circle
of
the
town
in
which
you
live
,
then
you
live
a
narrow
restricted
life
.
But
if
you
are
interested
in
what
is
going
on
in
China
,
then
you
are
living
in
China
.
If
you
're
interested
in
the
characters
of
a
good
novel
,
then
you
are
living
with
those
highly
interesting
people
.
If
you
listen
intently
to
fine
music
,
you
are
away
from
your
immediate
surroundings
and
living
in
a
world
of
passion
and
imagination
.
 
To
be
or
not
to
be
--
-
to
live
intensely
and
richly
,
or
merely
to
exist
,
which
depends
on
ourselves
.
Let
us
widen
and
intensify
our
relations
.
While
we
live
,
let
us
live

"Visit
any
junior
high
or
high
school
and
you
will
experience
the
power
of
influence
.
Clothing
,
hairstyles
,
attitudes
and
even
the
language
are
all
gained
by
some
amount
of
influence
,
whether
it
is
from
commercials
,
fashion
,
trends
,
celebrities
or
music
.
Teens
and
preteen
children
are
influenced
by
these
various
factors
.
However
,
a
child
's
friends
are
the
No
.
1
influence
.
 
Before
you
think
your
children
's
friends
could
never
lead
one
another
astray
,
think
again
.
A
child
may
experience
an
event
that
has
caused
overwhelming
stress
or
may
have
problems
at
home
or
school
,
which
causes
negative
behavior
.
Negative
influences
of
a
child
's
friends
can
come
without
warning
.
 
""
Parents
who
ask
their
children
where
they
are
going
,
who
they
are
going
with
and
request
a
meeting
with
their
children
's
friends
and
the
friends
'
parents
have
already
taken
the
first
step
,
""
says
Mara
Berkley
,
family
therapist
and
professor
at
Bristol
University
in
Rhode
Island
.
 
Lynn
Rexroat
of
Chillicothe
,
Illinois
,
uses
this
method
to
keep
tabs
on
her
children
.
""
My
oldest
son
knows
that
in
order
for
him
to
go
anywhere
with
a
friend
,
especially
one
I
have
n't
met
before
,
I
have
to
speak
with
that
friend
's
parent
to
make
sure
the
arrangements
are
agreeable
with
us
both
,
""
she
says
.
""
I
do
n't
interrogate
them
by
asking
about
their
private
life
.
I
just
want
to
know
that
the
parents
of
the
other
child
know
what
the
boys
are
planning
to
do
.
I
feel
that
by
my
wanting
to
know
I
am
protecting
my
son
.
""
 
When
a
parent
suspects
that
their
child
is
hanging
out
with
""
the
wrong
crowd
""
,
the
last
thing
on
their
mind
should
be
discipline
.
Instead
,
Berkley
says
a
parent
should
be
more
interested
in
finding
out
the
reasons
behind
the
behaviors
and
the
child
's
choice
to
keep
company
with
these
types
of
friends

"An
English
saying
goes
:
""
All
work
and
no
play
makes
Jack
a
dull
boy
.
""
That
means
we
should
relax
after
a
day
's
hard
work
or
we
'll
be
unhealthy
.
 
Many
students
know
that
if
they
want
to
get
ideal
jobs
with
good
salaries
,
they
must
do
well
in
high
school
so
they
can
enter
good
universities
.
Therefore
,
they
spend
all
day
studying
without
time
to
relax
.
 
However
,
not
all
students
can
go
to
top
universities
even
if
they
work
very
hard
.
Students
are
pressurized
by
parents
and
teachers
who
are
just
concerned
about
their
studies
and
exam
scores
while
ignoring
their
hobbies
and
individual
differences
.
As
a
result
,
students
are
forces
to
work
harder
and
harder
.
Furthermore
,
there
is
pressure
coming
from
students
themselves
.
They
realize
they
have
a
slim
chance
of
getting
into
a
top
university
as
competition
is
fierce
.
So
,
they
put
a
lot
of
stress
on
themselves
and
stay
in
a
nervous
state
day
after
day
.
If
they
keep
it
up
,
they
'll
suffer
illnesses
;
both
psychological
and
physical
.
 
What
students
need
is
relaxation
.
This
does
n't
mean
that
they
should
give
up
their
ambitions
and
stop
studying
hard
.
It
means
""
work
while
you
work
,
play
while
you
play
""
.
If
you
can
do
this
,
you
will
improve
your
health
greatly
.
You
'll
feel
yourself
suddenly
fresh
,
just
like
recovering
from
a
terrible
illness
.
You
'll
find
that
your
studies
are
not
a
burden
anymore

"Many
people
turn
to
doctors
or
self-help
books
,
but
they
ignore
a
powerful
thing
that
could
help
them
fight
illness
:
their
friends
.
 
Researchers
are
only
now
starting
to
pay
attention
to
the
importance
of
friendship
in
health
.
A
10-year
Australian
study
found
that
old
People
with
a
large
circle
of
friends
.
A
large
2007
study
showed
an
increase
of
nearly
60
percent
in
the
risk
for
obesity
among
people
whose
friends
gained
weight
.
And
last
year
,
Harvard
researchers
reported
that
strong
social
ties
could
improve
brain
health
as
we
age
.
 
""
In
general
,
the
role
of
friendship
in
our
lives
isn
’
t
well
realized
,
""
said
Rebecca
,
a
professor
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
.
""
Friendship
has
a
bigger
effect
on
our
psychological
health
than
family
relationships
.
""
 
While
many
friendship
studies
are
about
the
close
relationships
of
women
,
some
research
shows
that
it
can
do
good
to
men
too
.
In
a
six-year
study
of
736
middle-aged
men
,
having
friendships
reduces
the
risk
of
heart
attack
.
Only
smoking
was
as
important
a
risk
factor
as
having
little
social
support
.
 
Exactly
why
friendship
has
such
a
big
effect
is
n't
entirely
clear
.
While
friends
can
send
a
sick
person
to
the
hospital
or
pick
up
medicine
,
the
advantages
go
well
beyond
physical
help
.
Friendship
clearly
has
a
big
psychological
effect
.
""
People
with
stronger
friendships
feel
like
there
is
someone
they
can
turn
to
,
""
said
Karen
,
a
doctor
.
""
The
message
of
these
studies
is
that
friends
make
your
life
better
.

"""
Family
""
is
of
course
an
elastic
word
.
But
when
British
people
say
that
their
society
is
based
on
family
life
,
they
are
thinking
of
""
family
""
in
its
narrow
,
peculiarly
European
sense
of
mother
,
father
and
children
living
together
alone
in
their
own
house
as
an
economic
and
social
unit
.
Thus
,
every
British
marriage
indicates
the
beginning
of
a
new
and
independent
family
--
hence
the
tremendous
importance
of
marriage
in
British
life
.
For
both
the
man
and
the
woman
,
marriage
means
leaving
one
's
parents
and
starting
one
's
own
life
.
The
man
's
first
duty
will
then
be
to
his
wife
,
and
the
wife
's
to
her
husband
.
He
will
be
entirely
responsible
for
her
financial
support
,
and
she
for
the
running
of
the
new
home
.
Their
children
will
be
their
common
responsibility
and
theirs
alone
.
Neither
the
wife
's
parents
nor
the
husband
's
,
nor
their
brothers
or
sisters
,
aunts
or
uncles
,
have
any
right
to
interfere
with
them
--
they
are
their
own
masters
.
 
Readers
of
novels
like
Jane
Austen
's
Pride
and
Prejudice
will
know
that
in
former
times
marriage
among
wealthy
families
were
arranged
by
the
girl
's
parents
,
that
is
,
it
was
the
parents
'
duty
to
find
a
suitable
husband
for
their
daughter
,
preferably
a
rich
one
,
and
by
skillful
encouragement
to
lead
him
eventually
to
ask
their
permission
to
marry
her
.
Until
that
time
,
the
girl
was
protected
and
maintained
in
the
parents
'
home
,
and
the
financial
relief
of
getting
rid
of
her
could
be
seen
in
their
giving
the
newly
married
pair
a
sum
of
money
called
a
dowry
.
It
is
very
different
today
.
Most
girls
of
today
get
a
job
when
they
leave
school
and
become
financially
independent
before
their
marriage
.
This
has
had
two
results
.
A
girl
chooses
her
own
husband
,
and
she
gets
no
dowry

"0ur
village
carpenter
,
John
Hill
,
came
one
day
and
made
a
dining
table
for
my
wife
.
He
made
it
just
the
right
size
to
fill
the
space
between
the
two
window
.
When
I
got
home
that
evening
,
John
was
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
and
writing
out
his
bill
for
his
job

My
wife
said
to
me
quietly
,
""
That
's
his
ninth
cup
of
tea
today

""
But
she
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
""
It

,

n't
it
?
""
""
I
'll
decide
about
that
when
I
see
the
bill
,

I
said
.
John
laughed
and
gave
me
his
bill
for
the
work
.
I
read

John
looked
hard
at
me
for
half
a
minute
.
Was
there
a
little
smile
in
his
two
blue
eyes
?
I
gave
his

him

I
said

"My
friend
Mike
was
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
.
""
That
young
woman
who
just
waited
on
me
,
""
he
said
,
pointing
to
an
employee
of
the
fast
food
restaurant
where
we
were
eating
,
""
had
to
call
someone
over
to
help
her
count
change
.
The
cash
register
showed
her
I
needed
99
cents
,
but
she
could
n't
figure
out
how
to
count
out
the
coins
.
""
I
understood
Mike
's
concern
.
What
we
have
done
is
to
create
several
generations
of
individuals
most
of
whom
have
no
idea
how
to
reason
;
how
to
do
simple
math
;
how
to
do
research
;
or
,
finally
,
how
to
be
creative
.
The
reason
for
this
is
our
overuse
of
information
technology
:
video
games
,
television
,
digital
watches
,
calculators
,
and
computers
.
Information
technology
feeds
us
information
without
requiring
us
to
think
about
it
and
let
us
perform
operations
without
understanding
them
.
 
It
is
time
we
took
a
hard
look
at
an
educational
system
that
only
teaches
our
children
how
to
push
buttons
.
Our
kids
ca
n't
tell
time
if
the
clock
has
hands
.
They
can
use
calculators
,
but
can
not
add
,
subtract
,
divide
,
or
multiply
.
Video
games
have
taken
the
place
of
active
,
imaginative
play
.
Although
most
of
them
are
technically
educated
,
they
choose
not
to
read
.
They
are
so
used
to
television
and
movies
that
they
can
not
use
their
imagination
to
stay
interested
in
a
book
.
 
Therefore
,
we
must
do
something
to
help
our
children
.
If
we
do
n't
,
they
will
never
learn
how
to
solve
problems
.
They
will
never
learn
even
basic
reasoning
skills
and
will
certainly
not
develop
creativity
.
Instead
of
filling
classrooms
with
electronics
,
let
's
concentrate
on
good
old-fashioned
literacy
--
reading
books
.
Students
must
see
how
things
work
and
how
processes
lead
to
results
,
and
they
must
also
stretch
their
imagination

"Hunters
in
Mississippi
broke
a
state
record
for
the
heaviest
alligator
ever
killed
,
kicking
off
the
hunting
season
with
two
big
catches
.
 
Dustin
Bockman
of
Wisconsin
and
two
hunting
friends
caught
the
727-pound
13-foot-long
beast
on
Sunday
,
beating
last
year
's
record-setter
by
26
pounds
,
according
to
the
state
's
Department
of
Wildlife
,
Fisheries
and
Parks
.
 
""
We
're
going
to
cook
it
for
sure
.
""
he
told
Gulf
Live
.
 
""
There
's
plenty
for
me
and
everybody
else
.
""
 
He
and
his
team
of
hunters
followed
the
huge
creature
for
12
hours
until
they
could
get
close
enough
to
shoot
him
with
a
crossbow
.
 
""
He
would
go
to
the
bottom
and
sit
like
a
piece
of
wood
.
You
could
do
anything
with
him
,
""
Bockman
said
.
 
The
hunters
then
had
to
figure
out
how
to
drag
the
beast
's
dead
body
into
their
boat
.
 
It
look
four
hours
of
pulling
at
which
point
they
rested
on
a
sandbar
and
called
friends
for
help
.
 
First-time
hunter
Beth
Trammell
initially
broke
the
record
when
she
caught
a
723-pound
13-foot
gator
with
a
team
of
six
hunters
,
but
Bockman
stole
her
thunder
hours
later
.
 
She
was
shocked
at
her
gator
's
size
.
""
It
took
about
four
hours
to
get
it
in
the
boat
,
""
she
said
.
""
We
had
to
ask
another
boat
to
help
us
out
it
was
so
big
.
""
 
She
said
that
she
,
too
,
was
going
to
eat
the
beast
and
use
it
for
decoration
.
 
""
I
think
my
brother-in-law
is
going
to
get
the
head
mounted
.
""
she
said
.
 
Alligators
nearly
died
out
in
Mississippi
in
the
1960s
,
but
a
conservation
helped
the
creature
recover
to
the
point
that
hunting
is
now
legal

"France
is
one
of
the
largest
countries
in
Europe
.
It
is
bordered
by
six
countries
--
Belgium
,
Luxembourg
and
Germany
to
the
north-east
,
Switzerland
and
Italy
across
the
Alps
to
the
south-east
and
Spain
across
the
Pyrenees
to
the
south-west
.
The
UK
is
across
the
English
Channel
.
France
has
several
large
international
airports
,
two
of
which
are
in
the
capital
,
Paris
.
Visitors
from
the
UK
also
can
take
the
Channel
Tunnel
rail
link
down
to
France
.
In
France
,
the
highway
network
and
French
rail
service
are
known
to
be
extremely
efficient
with
the
high-speed
,
and
they
become
the
envy
of
other
nations
.
 
France
is
the
world
's
most
popular
tourist
destination
.
The
country
has
an
extremely
beautiful
scene
and
an
equally
comfortable
climate
to
match
.
This
makes
it
suitable
for
a
huge
range
of
exciting
sporting
and
other
outdoor
activities
.
For
example
,
France
has
a
huge
range
of
golf
courses
.
However
,
France
also
centers
on
a
large
scale
for
those
who
prefer
a
serene
life
.
Numerous
museums
and
art
galleries
in
France
bring
you
much
peacefulness
while
they
make
you
learn
about
the
country
's
rich
cultural
,
educational
and
political
heritage
.
 
The
French
people
--
and
particularly
the
older
generations
--
tend
to
be
extremely
polite
and
formal
,
a
national
character
that
is
often
dismissed
as
arrogance
by
other
nations
.
The
French
are
also
famous
for
taking
great
pride
in
their
personal
appearance
and
in
particular
,
their
clothes
.
 
The
French
love
their
food
.
Meals
are
long
whenever
possible
.
Sociable
family
meals
usually
cost
several
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
French
meals
usually
have
three
or
four
courses
including
cheese
before
the
dessert
and
are
accompanied
by
wine
and
freshly
baked
breads
.
However
,
French
food
varies
greatly
from
area
to
area

"On

8
,
Xinhua
News
Agency
published
a
list
of
news
keywords
that
it
believes
sum
up
the
year
2009

The
phrase
""
low-carbon
life
""
had
been
heard
in
China
before
2009
,
but
in
2009
,
it
has
become
popular
among
young
Chinese
who
are
concerned
about
the
environment
.
It
comes
as
world
leaders
are
talking
about
fighting
global
warming
in
Copenhagen
,
Denmark
.
Greenhouse
gases
,
such
as
carbon
dioxide
,
are
the
main
cause
of
global
warming
,
which
leads
to
extreme
weather
and
other
conditions
.
 
Living
a
low
carbon
life
means
trying
to
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
one
's
daily
life
.
For
example
,
burning
less
coal
and
oil
,
which
produce
CO
 
It
means
walking
,
biking
or
taking
buses
,
rather
than
using
a
private
car

had
died
of
it
as
of
December
9
.
But
as
US
magazine
 
pointed
out
recently
,
the
best
evidence
suggests
it
is
no
more
dangerous
than
a
bad
seasonal
flu
.
 
The
year
2009
saw
the
growing
impact
of
the
Internet
on
society
,
with
the
word
""
duomaomao
""
,
meaning
hide-and-seek
,
becoming
a
hit
on
the
web
.
On
February
12
,
Li
Qiaoming
died
of
brain
injuries
several
days
after
being
detained
by
police
in
Jinning
county
,
Yunnan
Province
.
Police
said
it
was
an
accident
sustained
while
he
was
playing
hide-and-seek
with
his
fellow
prisoners
.
 
cast
doubt
on
this
explanation
and
called
for
an
investigation
.
It
turned
out
that
Li
had
been
beaten
to
death
by
other
prisoners
.
 
Another
phrase
connected
with
the
Internet
on
the
list
is
""
Net
Addiction
Camps
""
.
Many
parents
send
children
obsessed
with
the
web
to
""
Net
Addiction
Camps
""
for
treatment
.
But
some
camps
use
physical
punishment
or
electrical
shocks
.
In
2009
,
some
young
people
died
as
a
result
of
the
extreme
methods
,
which
led
to
a
nationwide
discussion
.
In
November
,
the
Ministry
of
Health
banned
the
use
of
physical
punishment
to
keep
children
off
the
net
and
dropped
the
term
""
net
addiction
""
.
It
did
not
say
that
excessive
net
use
is
a
mental
illness
either

"At
one
time
,
people
used
to
travel
to
foreign
countries
because
they
thought
they
would
be
different
from
home
--
the
building
,
the
food
,
the
national
dress
.
Nowadays
,
however
,
one
large
city
is
very
like
another
.
They
all
have
their
Hilton
or
Sheraton
Hotels
which
look
Hilton
or
Sheraton
Hotels
everywhere
.
They
all
have
their
McDonald
's
,
their
KFCs
,
their
Pizza
Huts
.
Office
buildings
look
the
same
everywhere
,
and
most
city
centers
are
full
of
office
buildings
.
And
,
of
course
,
people
are
driving
the
same
brands
of
Japanese
or
European
cars
,
usually
wearing
the
same
kinds
of
clothing
and
the
world
's
airlines
are
all
flying
the
same
aircraft
,
Boeings
or
Airbuses
.
 
What
,
therefore
,
is
the
purpose
of
foreign
travel
for
people
who
are
not
on
business
?
What
do
tourists
hope
to
experience
in
a
foreign
country
that
they
can
not
experience
at
home
?
Why
travel
to
foreign
countries
at
all
?
The
answer
could
be
that
people
are
very
interested
in
the
past
.
It
is
a
nation
's
history
that
is
its
main
attraction
.
Most
of
today
's
tourists
travel
overseas
to
find
out
what
foreign
countries
and
cultures
used
to
be
like
,
not
what
they
are
like
today
.
The
words
""
cultural
tourism
""
are
now
part
of
the
language
of
tourism
,
and
it
is
the
museums
and
works
of
art
in
many
countries
that
are
their
main
attractions
.
 
If
they
are
lucky
--
and
have
had
sensible
,
strong
governments
--
many
countries
also
usually
have
at
least
a
few
beautiful
places
for
tourists
to
visit
.
 
Finally
there
is
perhaps
a
nation
's
greatest
attraction
:
its
people
.
A
nation
is
not
just
its
historical
buildings
,
its
works
of
art
or
beautiful
places
,
it
is
also
the
people
who
live
in
it
.
This
is
why
a
country
such
as
Thailand
attracts
millions
of
people
every
year
.
They
come
mainly
because
of
the
friendliness
of
the
Thai
people
.
It
is
why
the
Pacific
Islands
are
also
so
popular
.
There
may
not
be
much
to
see
or
do
in
Fiji
,
but
there
are
lots
of
friendly
,
smiling
people
to
make
visitors
feel
welcome

"In
1974
,
after
filling
out
fifty
applications
,
going
through
four
interviews
,
and
winning
one
offer
,
I
took
what
I
could
get
--
--
-
a
teaching
job
at
what
I
considered
a
distant
wild
area
:
western
New
Jersey
.
My
characteristic
optimism
was
alive
only
when
I
reminded
myself
that
I
would
be
doing
what
I
had
wanted
to
do
since
I
was
fourteen
--
--
--
-
teaching
English
.
 
School
started
,
but
I
felt
more
and
more
as
if
I
were
in
a
foreign
country
.
Was
this
rural
area
really
New
Jersey
?
My
students
took
a
week
off
when
hunting
season
began
.
I
was
told
they
were
also
frequently
absent
in
late
October
to
help
their
fathers
make
hay
on
the
farms
.
I
was
a
young
woman
from
New
York
City
,
who
thought
that
""
Make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
""
just
meant
to
have
a
good
time
.
 
But
,
still
,
I
was
teaching
English
.
I
worked
hard
,
taking
time
off
only
to
eat
and
sleep
.
And
then
there
was
my
sixth-grade
class
--
--
seventeen
boys
and
five
girls
who
were
only
six
years
younger
than
me
.
I
had
a
problem
long
before
I
knew
it
.
I
was
struggling
in
my
work
as
a
young
idealistic
teacher
.
I
wanted
to
make
literature
come
alive
and
to
promote
a
love
of
the
written
word
.
The
students
wanted
to
throw
spitballs
and
whisper
dirty
words
in
the
back
of
the
room
.
 
In
college
I
had
been
taught
that
a
successful
educator
should
ignore
bad
behavior
.
So
I
did
,
confident
that
,
as
the
textbook
had
said
,
the
bad
behavior
would
disappear
as
I
gave
my
students
positive
attention
.
It
sounds
reasonable
,
but
the
text
evidently
ignored
the
fact
that
humans
,
particularly
teenagers
,
rarely
seem
reasonable
.
By
the
time
my
boss
,
who
was
also
my
taskmaster
,
known
to
be
the
strictest
,
most
demanding
,
most
quick
to
fire
inexperienced
teachers
,
came
into
the
classroom
to
observe
me
,
the
students
exhibited
very
little
good
behavior
to
praise
.
 
My
boss
sat
in
the
back
of
the
room
.
The
boys
in
the
class
were
making
animal
noises
,
hitting
each
other
while
the
girls
filed
their
nails
or
read
magazines
.
I
just
pretended
it
all
was
n't
happening
,
and
went
on
lecturing
and
tried
to
ask
some
inspiring
questions
.
My
boss
,
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
classroom
,
seemed
to
be
growing
bigger
and
bigger
.
After
twenty
minutes
he
left
,
silently
.
Visions
of
unemployment
marched
before
my
eyes
.
 
I
felt
mildly
victorious
that
I
got
through
the
rest
of
class
without
crying
,
but
at
my
next
free
period
I
had
to
face
him
.
I
wondered
if
he
would
let
me
finish
out
the
day
.
I
walked
to
his
office
,
took
a
deep
breath
,
and
opened
the
door
.
 
He
was
sitting
in
his
chair
,
and
he
looked
at
me
long
and
hard
.
I
said
nothing
.
All
I
could
think
of
was
that
I
was
not
an
English
teacher
;
I
had
been
lying
to
myself
,
pretending
that
everything
was
fine
.
 
When
he
spoke
,
he
said
simply
,
without
accusation
,
""
You
had
nothing
to
say
to
them
.
""
 
""
You
had
nothing
to
say
to
them
""
.
he
repeated
.
""
No
wonder
they
are
bored
.
Why
not
get
to
the
meat
of
literature
and
stop
talking
about
symbolism
.
Talk
with
them
,
not
at
them
.
And
more
important
,
why
do
you
ignore
their
bad
behavior
""
?
We
talked
.
He
named
my
problems
and
offered
solutions
.
We
role-played
.
He
was
the
bad
student
,
and
I
was
the
forceful
,
yet
,
warm
teacher
.
 
As
the
year
progressed
,
we
spent
many
hours
discussing
literature
and
ideas
about
human
beings
and
their
motivations
.
He
helped
me
identify
my
weaknesses
and
strengths
.
In
short
,
he
made
a
teacher
of
me
by
teaching
me
the
reality
of
Emerson
's
words
:
""
The
secret
to
education
lies
in
respecting
the
pupil
.
""
 
Fifteen
years
later
I
still
drive
that
same
winding
road
to
the
same
school
.
Thanks
to
the
help
I
received
that
difficult
first
year
,
the
school
is
my
home
now

"Time
was
running
out
,
and
Mark
Dickinson
was
n't
sure
whether
he
'd
get
to
see
his
dying
2-year-old
grandson
one
last
time
.
A
long
line
at
Los
Angeles
International
Airport
's
security
checkpoint
had
kept
him
from
getting
to
his
gate
on
time
.
 
His
grandson
Caden
would
be
taken
off
life
support
in
a
matter
of
hours
in
Denver
,
Colorado
,
with
or
without
his
grandfather
's
presence
,
according
to
CNN
affiliate
KABC
.
 
""
I
was
kind
of
panicking
because
I
was
running
late
,
and
I
really
thought
I
was
n't
going
to
make
the
flight
,
""
Dickinson
told
KABC
.
 
That
's
when
a
pilot
from
Southwest
Airlines
stepped
up
and
held
the
flight
at
the
gate
until
Dickinson
arrived
.
The
pilot
was
standing
by
the
air
bridge
waiting
for
him
when
Dickinson
arrived
in
socks
,
so
rushed
that
he
just
grabbed
his
shoes
at
security
and
ran
through
the
terminal
.
 
""
I
told
him
,
'Thank
you
so
much
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
much
I
appreciated
that
.
'
And
he
said
,
'No
problem
.
They
ca
n't
leave
without
me
anyway
,
'
""
Dickinson
told
KABC
.
 
Authorities
say
Dickinson
's
grandson
,
Caden
Rodgers
,
suffered
a
head
injury
after
his
mother
's
boyfriend
threw
him
across
the
room
.
The
boyfriend
reportedly
told
police
he
was
drunk
and
high
on
marijuana
at
the
time
.
The
child
later
died
and
the
boyfriend
has
been
charged
with
first-degree
murder
,
according
to
the
Aurora
Sentinel
.
 
Thanks
to
the
pilot
,
Dickinson
made
it
to
Colorado
in
time
to
say
goodbye
to
his
grandson
.
Most
airlines
would
punish
any
staff
member
who
holds
up
a
flight
,
according
to
consumer
advocate
Christopher
Elliott
,
who
broke
the
story
of
the
sympathetic
pilot
on
his
blog
.
However
,
a
Southwest
spokeswoman
said
the
pilot
's
actions
were
praiseworthy
.
 
""
You
ca
n't
hold
a
plane
for
every
late
customer
,
but
I
think
we
would
all
agree
that
these
were
extenuating
circumstances
and
the
pilot
absolutely
made
the
right
decision
,
""
Southwest
spokeswoman
Marilee
McInnis
said
.
""
I
do
n't
think
you
could
ask
for
a
better
example
of
great
service
for
our
customers
.

"Vancouver
.
B.C.
--
For
six
months
.
Ted
Schredd
and
Deanna
Kopel
cycled
around
North
America
to
show
others
a
way
to
help
the
environment
.
""
Nobody
wants
to
breathe
dirty
air
--
but
for
the
air
to
change
.
People
have
to
stop
driving
cars
,
""
says
Ted
,
""
If
more
people
start
riding
bikes
,
the
air
will
be
cleaner
.
""
 
Ted
started
his
trip
alone
.
He
had
$
160
in
his
pocket
and
plans
to
cycle
around
North
America
.
He
left
his
hometown
of
Vancouver
,
and
when
he
arrived
in
San
Diego
he
got
the
chance
to
make
some
extra
money
for
the
rest
of
his
13
,
000
km
trip
.
A
cyclist
he
met
asked
him
to
speak
at
an
environment
meeting
in
Texas
.
Within
a
few
hours
,
Ted
was
on
a
plane
to
the
meeting
and
a
big
surprise
.
 
When
he
met
Deanna
at
the
meeting
,
they
talked
for
six
hours
straight
.
It
was
love
at
first
sight
.
The
next
day
,
he
called
her
to
ask
if
she
wanted
to
finish
the
trip
with
him
.
She
said
yes
,
sold
everything
in
her
flat
,
gave
her
notice
at
work
,
and
was
on
the
road
with
Ted
three
weeks
later
.
 
Deanna
found
Ted
's
timetable
difficult
because
he
got
up
early
in
the
morning
.
Deanna
was
a
nurse
and
usually
worked
at
night
.
""
All
of
a
sudden
,
I
was
up
at
six
when
I
wanted
to
sleep
until
noon
,
""
said
Deanna
.
 
As
the
couple
cycled
to
Florida
and
up
to
Montreal
and
then
back
to
Vancouver
,
every
day
was
an
adventure
.
They
got
free
meals
in
restaurants
,
and
slept
in
people
's
yards
.
When
they
ran
out
of
money
,
people
gave
them
extra
cash
.
Sometimes
people
gave
away
$
50
or
$
100
.
 
And
like
all
good
stories
this
one
has
a
happy
ending
.
On
the
way
back
to
Vancouver
,
they
stopped
in
Edmonton
to
visit
Ted
's
relatives
.
During
the
visit
,
they
got
married
.
People
tied
ten
cans
and
a
""
Just
Married
""
sign
to
the
back
of
their
bikes
.
 
They
now
want
to
write
a
book
about
their
trip
.
""
We
want
people
to
know
that
you
can
protect
our
earth
and
still
have
fun
,

Schredd

"Animals
do
many
different
,
amazing
things
to
get
through
the
winter
.
Some
of
them
migrate
.
They
travel
to
other
places
where
the
weather
is
warmer
or
where
they
can
find
food
.
 
Many
birds
migrate
in
autumn
.
Because
the
trip
can
be
dangerous
,
some
travel
in
large
groups
.
For
example
,
geese
fly
in
noisy
,
""
V
""
-shaped
groups
.
Other
kinds
of
birds
fly
alone
.
 
Some
animals
stay
active
in
winter
.
They
must
change
themselves
as
the
weather
changes
.
Many
change
their
doing
or
their
bodies
.
For
example
,
snowshoe
rabbits
grow
white
fur
to
help
them
hide
in
the
snow
.
 
Food
is
hard
to
find
in
winter
.
Some
animals
,
like
mice
,
collect
lots
of
food
in
autumn
and
store
it
to
eat
later
.
Some
animals
eat
different
kinds
of
food
as
the
seasons
change
.
 
Some
animals
hibernate
for
part
or
all
of
the
winter
.
This
is
a
special
,
very
deep
sleep
.
The
animal
's
body
temperature
drops
,
and
its
heartbeat
and
breathing
slow
down
.
It
uses
very
little
energy
.
In
autumn
,
these
animals
get
ready
for
winter
by
eating
much
more
food
than
in
summer
and
storing
it
as
body
fat
.
They
use
this
fat
to
keep
them
alive
while
hibernating
.
 
Water
makes
good
protection
for
many
animals
.
When
the
weather
gets
cold
,
they
move
to
the
bottom
of
lakes
and
rivers
.
There
,
frogs
and
many
fish
hide
under
rocks
or
fallen
leaves
.
Cold
water
holds
more
oxygen
than
warm
water
,
and
frogs
can
breathe
through
their
skin
.
 
Every
type
of
insect
has
its
own
life
cycle
and
that
is
the
way
it
grows
and
changes
.
Different
insects
spend
the
winter
in
different
forms
of
their
lives
.
Some
insects
also
spend
the
winter
without
moving
.
Some
insects
spend
the
winter
as
pupae
.
Other
insects
die
after
laying
eggs
in
autumn
.
The
eggs
change
into
new
insects
in
spring
and
everything
begins
all
over
again

"Jobs
and
work
do
much
more
than
most
of
us
realize
to
provide
happiness
and
contentment
.
We
're
all
used
to
thinking
that
work
provides
the
material
things
of
life
--
the
goods
and
services
that
make
our
modern
civilization
possible
.
But
we
are
much
less
conscious
of
the
degree
to
which
work
provides
the
more
important
psychological
wellbeing
that
can
make
the
difference
between
a
full
and
an
empty
life
.
 
Historically
,
work
has
been
associated
with
slavery
and
sin
and
punishment
.
And
in
our
own
day
we
are
used
to
bearing
traditional
complaints
.
Against
this
background
,
it
may
well
come
as
a
surprise
to
learn
that
not
only
psychologists
but
other
behavioral
scientists
have
come
to
accept
the
positive
contribution
of
work
to
the
individual
's
happiness
and
sense
of
personal
achievement
.
Work
is
more
than
a
necessity
for
most
human
beings
;
it
is
the
focus
of
their
lives
,
the
source
of
their
identity
and
creativity
.
 
Rather
than
a
punishment
of
a
burden
,
work
is
the
opportunity
to
realize
one
's
potential
.
And
the
opposite
is
true
,
too
.
For
large
numbers
of
people
,
the
absence
of
work
is
harmful
to
their
health
.
Retirement
often
brings
many
problems
surrounding
the
""
What
do
I
do
with
myself
?
""
question
,
even
though
there
may
be
no
financial
cares
.
Large
numbers
of
people
regularly
get
headaches
and
other
illnesses
on
weekends
when
they
do
n't
have
their
jobs
to
go
to
,
and
must
take
care
of
themselves
.
It
has
been
observed
that
unemployment
,
quite
apart
from
financial
pressures
,
brings
enormous
psychological
troubles
and
that
many
individuals'conditions
become
worse
rapidly
when
jobless
.
 
But
why
?
Why
should
work
be
such
a
significant
source
of
human
satisfaction
?
A
good
share
of
the
answer
rests
in
the
kind
of
pride
that
is
stimulated
by
the
job
,
by
the
activity
of
accomplishing

"I
lost
my
sight
when
I
was
four
years
old
by
falling
off
a
box
car
in
a
freight
yard
in
Atlantic
City
and
landing
on
my
head
.
Now
I
am
thirty
two
.
I
can
slightly
remember
the
brightness
of
sunshine
and
what
color
red
is
.
It
would
be
wonderful
to
see
again
,
but
a
calamity
can
do
strange
things
to
people
.
It
occurred
to
me
the
other
day
that
I
might
not
have
come
to
love
life
as
I
do
if
I
had
n't
been
blind
.
I
believe
in
life
now
.
I
am
not
so
sure
that
I
would
have
believed
in
it
so
deeply
,
otherwise
.
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
would
prefer
to
go
without
my
eyes
.
I
simply
mean
that
the
loss
of
them
made
me
appreciate
the
more
what
I
had
left
.
 
Life
,
I
believe
,
asks
a
continuous
series
of
adjustments
to
reality
.
The
more
readily
a
person
is
able
to
make
these
adjustments
,
the
more
meaningful
his
own
private
world
becomes
.
The
adjustment
is
never
easy
.
I
was
totally
confused
and
afraid
.
But
I
was
lucky
.
My
parents
and
my
teachers
saw
something
in
me
--
a
potential
to
live
,
you
might
call
it
--
which
I
did
n't
see
,
and
they
made
me
want
to
fight
it
out
with
blindness
.
 
The
hardest
lesson
I
had
to
learn
was
to
believe
in
myself
.
That
was
basic
.
If
I
had
n't
been
able
to
do
that
,
I
would
have
collapsed
and
become
a
chair
rocker
on
the
front
porch
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
When
I
say
belief
in
myself
I
am
not
talking
about
simply
the
kind
of
self
confidence
that
helps
me
down
an
unfamiliar
staircase
alone
.
That
is
part
of
it
.
But
I
mean
something
bigger
than
that
:
an
assurance
that
I
am
,
despite
imperfections
,
a
real
,
positive
person
;
that
somewhere
in
the
sweeping
,
intricate
pattern
of
people
there
is
a
special
place
where
I
can
make
myself
fit
.
 
It
took
me
years
to
discover
and
strengthen
this
assurance
.
It
had
to
start
with
the
simplest
things
.
Once
a
man
gave
me
an
indoor
baseball
.
I
thought
he
was
making
fun
of
me
and
I
was
hurt
.
""
I
ca
n't
use
this
.
""
I
said
.
""
Take
it
with
you
,
""
he
urged
me
,
""
and
roll
it
around
.
""
The
words
stuck
in
my
head
.
""
Roll
it
around
!
""
By
rolling
the
ball
I
could
hear
where
it
went
.
This
gave
me
an
idea
how
to
achieve
a
goal
I
had
thought
impossible
:
playing
baseball
.
At
Philadelphia
's
Overbrook
School
for
the
Blind
I
invented
a
successful
variation
of
baseball
.
We
called
it
ground
ball
.
 
All
my
life
I
have
set
ahead
of
me
a
series
of
goals
and
then
tried
to
reach
them
,
one
at
a
time
.
I
had
to
learn
my
limitations
.
It
was
no
good
to
try
for
something
I
knew
at
the
start
was
wildly
out
of
reach
because
that
only
invited
the
bitterness
of
failure
.
I
would
fail
sometimes
anyway
but
on
the
average
I
made
progress

"Sophie
is
a
middle
school
student
.
Her
mother
is
a
dentist
and
her
father
is
a
writer
.
Sophie
wants
to
be
a
cook
.
Sophie
went
to
take
part
in
a
cake
making
competition
yesterday
.
 
Everyone
began
to
make
a
cake
.
But
Sophie
had
n't
decided
what
kind
of
cake
to
make
.
 
There
was
only
half
an
hour
left
.
Sophie
had
not
even
begun
.
So
she
began
to
panic
.
Then
she
got
an
idea
.
She
ran
out
and
came
to
a
cake
shop
.
She
gave
fifty
dollars
to
the
shop
keeper
and
said
,
""
Please
give
me
a
chocolate
cake
.
""
 
Then
Sophie
came
back
and
put
the
chocolate
cake
on
the
table
.
But
a
little
boy
saw
her
do
that
.
 
When
the
judges
were
just
about
to
taste
Sophie
's
cake
,
the
little
boy
said
to
the
judges
,
""
Please
do
n't
taste
her
cake
.
She
did
n't
make
it
and
she
bought
it
from
a
cake
shop
.
""
 
The
judges
were
angry

"The
United
States
estimates
that
about
one
out
of
every
10
people
on
the
planet
today
is
at
least
60
years
old
.
By
2050
,
it
's
projected
to
be
one
out
of
5
.
This
means
that
not
only
will
there
be
more
old
people
,
but
there
will
be
relatively
fewer
young
people
to
support
them
.
 
Professor
Richard
Lee
of
the
University
of
California
at
Berkeley
says
this
aging
of
the
world
has
a
great
effect
on
economics
.
""
Population
aging
increases
the
concentration
of
population
in
the
older
ages
and
therefore
it
is
costly
,
""
he
said
.
 
Aging
populations
consume
more
and
produce
less
.
With
more
people
living
longer
,
it
could
get
expensive
.
But
Mr.
Lee
says
with
continuing
increases
in
worker
productivity
and
smart
planning
,
it
can
be
manageable
.
 
Societies
have
different
methods
for
caring
for
the
elderly
,
but
each
carries
a
cost
.
Generally
,
there
are
three
types
of
support
.
Seniors
can
live
off
the
wealth
they
gained
when
they
were
younger
.
They
can
rely
on
their
family
to
take
care
of
them
,
or
they
can
rely
on
the
government
.
 
In
industrialized
nations
,
governments
created
publicly-funded
support
systems
.
These
worked
relatively
well
until
recent
years
,
when
aging
population
growth
in
places
like
the
United
States
and
Western
Europe
began
to
gradually
weaken
the
systems
finances
.
These
nations
now
face
some
tough
choices
.
Mr.
Lee
says
the
elderly
in
some
of
these
countries
must
either
receive
less
money
,
retire
later
or
increase
taxes
to
make
the
system
continuable
.
 
Most
developing
nations
have
n't
built
this
type
of
government-funded
support
,
but
have
instead
relied
on
families
to
care
for
their
elderly
.
These
nations
also
generally
have
a
much
younger
population
,
which
means
their
situation
is
not
as
urgent
as
more
developed
nations
.
But
Mr.
Lee
says
that
does
n't
mean
they
can
ignore
the
issue
.
""
Third
World
countries
should
give
very
careful
thought
to
this
process
,
to
population
aging
and
how
it
may
affect
their
economies
--
now
,
before
population
aging
even
becomes
an
issue
,

"I
was
brought
up
in
the
British
,
stiff
upper
lip
style
.
Strong
feelings
are
n't
something
you
display
in
public
.
So
,
you
can
imagine
that
I
was
unprepared
for
the
outpouring
of
public
grief
at
a
Chinese
funeral
.
 
My
editorial
team
leader
died
recently
after
a
short
illness
.
He
was
31
.
The
news
was
so
unexpected
that
it
left
us
all
shocked
and
upset
.
A
female
colleague
burst
into
tears
and
cried
piteously
at
her
desk
.
Somehow
we
got
through
the
day
's
work
.
The
next
day
was
the
funeral
.
 
Our
big
boss
stepped
forward
to
deliver
a
eulogy
and
was
soon
in
tears
.
She
carried
on
,
in
Chinese
of
course
,
but
at
the
end
said
in
English
:
""
There
will
be
no
more
deadlines
for
you
in
heaven
.
""
Next
came
a
long-term
colleague
who
also
dissolved
in
tears
but
carried
on
with
her
speech
despite
being
almost
overcome
by
emotion
.
Then
a
close
friend
of
the
dead
man
paid
tribute
,
weeping
openly
as
he
spoke
.
Sorrow
is
spreading
.
Me
and
women
were
now
sobbing
uncontrollably
.
Finally
,
the
man
's
mother
,
supported
between
two
women
,
addressed
her
son
in
his
coffin
.
At
one
point
,
the
mother
almost
collapsed
and
had
to
be
held
up
.
We
were
invited
to
step
forward
to
each
lay
a
white
rose
on
the
casket
.
Our
dead
colleague
looked
as
if
he
was
taking
a
nap
.
At
the
end
of
the
service
I
walked
away
from
the
funeral
parlor
stunned
at
the
outpouring
of
emotion
.
 
In
the
UK
,
families
grieve
privately
and
then
try
to
hold
it
together
and
not
break
down
at
a
funeral
.
Here
in
China
it
would
seem
that
grieving
is
a
public
affair
.
It
strikes
me
that
it
is
more
cathartic
to
cry
your
eyes
out
than
try
to
keep
it
bottled
up
for
fear
of
embarrassment
,
which
is
what
many
of
us
do
in
the
West
.
 
Afterwards
,
a
Chinese
colleague
told
me
that
the
lamenting
at
the
funeral
had
been
restrained
by
Chinese
standards
.
In
some
rural
areas
,
she
said
,
people
used
to
be
paid
to
mourn
noisily
.
This
struck
me
like
something
out
of
novel
by
Charles
Dickens
.
But
we
have
all
seen
on
TV
scenes
of
grief-stricken
people
in
Gaza
and
the
West
Bank
,
in
Afghanistan
,
Iraq
and
the
relatives
of
victims
of
terrorist
bombings
around
the
world
.
Chinese
grief
is
no
different
.
I
realized
that
it
's
the
reserved
British
way
of
mourning
that
is
out
of
step
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.
 
It
was
our
newspaper
's
production
day
.
We
were
bussed
back
to
the
office
to
resume
work
.
No
more
deadlines
for
our
former
colleague
,
but
we
had
to
pull
together
to
put
the
newspaper
to
print
.
The
boss
invited
the
team
to
go
out
for
dinner
after
work
.
We
relaxed
,
smiled
,
joked
.
There
was
no
mention
of
the
funeral
or
our
poor
colleague
.
Enough
sorrow
had
been
shed
already
.
We
needed
a
break

"Can
you
imagine
a
world
without
chocolate
?
It
's
not
something
I
'd
like
to
do
,
so
I
was
relieved
to
read
that
there
's
a
university
with
a
programme
to
safeguard
the
future
of
chocolate
!
 
The
University
of
Reading
,
in
England
,
has
just
opened
a
new
clearing
house
for
all
the
world
's
new
cocoa
varieties
.
They
must
be
quarantined
before
they
can
be
grown
.
Why
?
Cocoa
production
hit
a
record
high
of
4.4
million
tons
last
year
but
about
30
%
of
the
precious
crop
is
regularly
lost
to
pests
and
diseases
.
Now
we
do
n't
want
that
,
do
we
?
 
Demand
for
chocolate
has
been
increasing
faster
than
the
world
supply
of
cocoa
and
researchers
think
that
new
varieties
are
key
to
solving
this
problem
.
 
The
University
of
Reading
has
been
protecting
the
quality
of
the
new
crop
since
1985
,
after
it
took
over
the
task
from
the
Royal
Botanical
Gardens
in
Kew
,
London
.
And
it
has
improved
its
facilities
.
The
leader
of
the
institution
's
cocoa
project
,
Professor
Paul
Hadley
,
says
,
""
One
of
the
main
issues
concerning
cocoa
improvement
is
the
supply
of
reliably
clean
,
healthy
,
interesting
cocoa
material
.
""
 
The
cocoa
centre
has
a
collection
of
400
plant
varieties
and
their
greenhouse
uses
a
lot
of
energy
to
keep
them
in
tropical
conditions
.
After
up
to
two
years
in
quarantine
,
clean
and
safe
seeds
are
sent
to
some
20
countries
,
including
several
in
West
Africa
.
That
's
where
75
%
of
the
cocoa
used
for
chocolate
worldwide
comes
from
.
The
crop
is
extremely
important
for
the
local
economy
:
it
employs
about
two
million
people
.
 
Professor
Paul
Hadley
says
he
works
with
a
small
team
of
skilled
technicians
who
look
after
the
collection
.
And
more
of
us
seem
to
count
on
them
now
.
 
The
scientist
says
,
""
There
is
some
concern
within
the
industry
that
demand
is
increasing
constantly
,
particularly
in
countries
like
China
,
where
the
standard
of
living
is
increasing
and
people
are
getting
a
taste
for
different
chocolates
.

"English
nowadays
is
widely
used
in
science
,
business
,
the
media
and
popular
culture
.
For
example
,
80

of
e-mails
on
the

are
in
English
.
But
where
will
English
be
at
the
end

21stcentury
?
 
One
view
is
that
English
is
going
to
become
even
more
important
as
a
global
language
,
being
most
widely
used
in
trade
and
media
while
some
other
languages
will
become
less
important
or
just
disappear
.
Another
view
is
that
English
is
already
breaking
up
into
several
separate
languages
.
There
are
already
dictionaries
of
the
""
New
Englishes
""
,
such
as
Australian
English
,
full
of
words
that
a
British
English
speaker
would
not
recognize
.
 
Hopefully
,
neither
of
these
things
will
happen
.
Although
different
varieties
of
English
will
continue
to
develop
around
the
world
,
standard
English
will
survive
for
international
communication
.
However
,
it
is
impossible
for
one
language
to
totally
control
the
world
.
Already
,
other
languages
are
fighting
back
against
the
control
of
English
on
the
net
.
Governments
around
the
world
are
also
starting
to
protect
smaller
languages
and
recognize
the
importance
of
keeping
a
variety
of
cultures
and
languages
.
English
will
probably
stay
in
control
for
a
long
time
,
but
it
certainly
wo
n't
become
the
only
language
in
the
world

"If
you
want
to
pay
a
visit
to
Iceland
,
you
'll
enter
a
whole
new
region
of
experience
.
You
'll
discover
original
nature
as
you
've
never
seen
it
before
.
The
freedom
to
wander
in
the
city
or
the
wilds
as
you
please
is
the
key
to
the
Iceland
experience
.
 
Reykjavik
,
the
capital
of
Iceland
,
is
just
a
part
of
the
Icelandic
experience
with
its
midnight
sun
or
the
magical
landscapes
mixed
with
ice
and
fire
.
Reykjavik
has
a
population
of
around
170,000
and
offers
an
interesting
mix
of
culture
and
local
village
roots
.
 
Old
accounts
say
the
ancient
gods
themselves
guided
Iceland
's
first
settler
to
make
his
home
in
Reykjavik
.
He
named
the
place
Reykjavik
(
Steamy
Bay
)
after
the
geothermal
steam
he
saw
,
which
today
heats
homes
and
outdoor
swimming
pools
throughout
the
city
,
a
pollution-free
energy
source
that
leaves
the
air
very
fresh
,
clean
and
clear
.
 
A
beautiful
river
runs
through
the
city
limits
,
and
so
do
fine
parks
and
even
wild
outdoor
areas
.
Against
this
backcloth
of
nature
,
Reykjavik
has
a
packed
program
of
familiar
city
joys
too
:
art
museums
,
several
theaters
,
an
opera
house
,
a
symphony
orchestra
and
concerts
meeting
the
needs
of
all
ages
and
tastes
.
 
One
must
for
all
visitors
is
dining
out
on
Icelandic
specialties
,
including
delicious
seafood
,
ocean-fresh
from
the
morning
'
s
catch
,
highland
lamb
and
unusual
varieties
of
game
.
Its
purely
natural
food
is
imaginatively
served
to
delight
the
most
discerning
of
diners
.
Reykjavik
is
also
famous
as
one
of
Europe
's
hottest
nightspots
,
where
the
action
on
the
friendly
pub
and
nightlife
scene
lasts
right
through
the
night
.
In
the
evening
,
the
downtown
area
is
filled
with
activity
,
reaching
its
peak
on
Friday
or
Saturday
.
The
number
of
pubs
,
cafe
,
discos
,
and
other
nightspots
in
the
downtown
area
is
astonishing
.
There
is
a
rich
variety
of
places
to
go
:
European-style
cafes
,
nightclubs
with
live
entertainment
,
dance
halls
for
seniors
,
sports-theme
pubs
with
big
TV
screens
,
cafes
that
offer
over
100
types
of
beer
,
an
Irish
pub
,
a
Spanish
cafe
,
a
French
wine
bar
.
 
Walking
distances
are
short
downtown
,
and
everything
worth
seeing
outside
the
city
center
can
be
quickly
and
conveniently
reached
by
bus
.
With
its
long
,
easy-going
main
street
and
large
shopping
mall
,
Iceland
's
capital
is
a
great
place
to
shop
too
--
with
a
bonus
of
tax-free
shopping
for
visitors
!
 
A
full
range
of
accommodations
is
available
in
Reykjavik
,
from
international-standard
hotels
with
good
conference
facilities
,
through
smaller
hotels
and
comfortable
guesthouses
,
to
a
campsite
in
the
city
's
biggest
park

"We
know
the
famous
ones
--
the
Thomas
Edisons
and
the
Alexander
Graham
Bells
--
but
what
about
the
less
famous
inventors
?
What
about
the
people
who
invented
the
traffic
light
and
the
windshield
wiper
?
Should
n't
we
know
who
they
are
?
 
Joan
Mclean
thinks
so
.
In
fact
,
Mclean
,
a
professor
of
physics
at
Mountain
University
in
Range
,
feels
so
strongly
about
this
matter
that
she
's
developed
a
course
on
the
topic
.
In
addition
to
learning
""
who
""
invented
""
what
""
,
however
,
Mclean
also
likes
her
students
to
learn
the
answers
to
the
""
why
""
and
""
how
""
questions
.
According
to
Mclean
.
""
When
students
learn
the
answers
to
these
questions
,
they
are
better
prepared
to
recognize
opportunities
for
inventing
and
more
motivated
to
give
inventing
a
try
.
""
 
Her
students
agree
.
One
young
man
with
a
patent
for
an
unbreakable
umbrella
is
walking
proof
of
McLean
's
statement
.
""
If
I
had
not
heard
the
story
of
the
windshield
wiper
's
invention
,
""
said
Tommy
Lee
,
a
senior
physics
major
,
""
I
never
would
have
dreamed
of
turning
my
bad
experience
during
a
rainstorm
into
something
so
constructive
.
""
Lee
is
currently
negotiating
to
sell
his
patent
to
an
umbrella
producer
.
 
So
,
just
what
is
the
story
behind
the
windshield
wiper
Well
,
Mary
Anderson
came
up
with
the
idea
in
1902
after
a
visit
to
New
York
City
.
The
day
was
cold
and
stormy
,
but
Anderson
still
wanted
to
see
the
sights
,
so
she
jumped
aboard
a
streetcar
.
Noticing
that
the
driver
was
struggling
to
see
through
the
snow
covering
the
windshield
,
she
found
herself
wondering
why
there
could
n't
be
a
built
--
in
device
for
cleaning
the
window
.
Still
wondering
about
this
when
she
returned
home
to
Birmingham
,
Alabama
,
Anderson
started
drafting
out
solutions
.
One
of
her
ideas
,
a
lever
on
the
inside
of
a
vehicle
that
would
control
an
arm
on
the
outside
,
became
the
first
windshield
wiper
.
 
Today
we
benefit
from
countless
inventions
and
innovations
.
It
's
hard
to
imagine
driving
without
Garrett
A.Morgan
's
traffic
light
.
It
's
equally
impossible
to
picture
a
world
without
Katherine
J.Blodgett
's
innovation
that
makes
glass
invisible
.
Can
you
picture
life
without
clear
windows
and
eyeglasses
?"	"1

"The
zebra
belongs
to
the
horse
family
.
One
of
nature
's
great
mysteries
is
why
the
zebra
has
stripes
.
One
theory
is
that
the
stripes
help
the
zebra
cool
down
.
On
hot
days
the
black
stripes
get
a
lot
hotter
than
the
white
area
of
the
zebra
and
under
the
black
stripes
there
are
special
layers
of
fat
for
protection
.
Hot
air
then
rises
off
the
black
stripes
,
forcing
colder
air
down
around
the
white
areas
,
cooling
the
zebra
down
.
This
,
however
,
is
just
a
kind
of
theory
.
The
stripes
can
also
confuse
predators
when
zebras
stay
with
other
animals
in
great
numbers
.
 
Zebras
have
excellent
hearing
and
eyesight
and
can
run
at
speeds
of
up
to
56
kilometers
per
hour
.
They
also
have
a
powerful
kick
that
can
cause
serious
injury
to
a
predator
,
like
a
lion
,
or
an
African
wild
dog
.
Usually
the
lead
male
of
the
herd
stays
at
the
back
of
the
group
to
defend
against
predators
if
necessary
,
while
the
females
and
youngsters
escape
danger
.
 
Zebras
are
herbivores
that
feed
only
on
plants
and
live
mostly
by
eating
grasses
,
although
they
also
might
eat
a
bit
on
the
leaves
and
stems
of
bushes
.
They
eat
grasses
for
many
hours
each
day
,
using
their
strong
teeth
.
Spending
so
much
time
chewing
wears
the
zebras
'
teeth
down
,
so
their
teeth
keep
growing
all
their
lives
.
As
the
dry
season
arrives
and
the
grasses
die
back
,
zebra
herds
travel
to
find
more
food
and
water
holes
for
drinking
.
Most
zebras
have
no
specific
territories
.
They
travel
from
place
to
place
,
never
staying
in
one
area
very
long

"Tim
Welford
,
aged
33
,
and
Dom
Mee
,
aged
30
,
both
from
England
,
were
keen
on
(
=
""
like
...
""
very
much
)
rowing
boats
.
They
made
a
plan
to
row
across
the
Pacific
Ocean
from
Japan
to
San
Francisco
.
The
name
of
their
rowboat
was
""
Crackers
""
.
It
was
about
seven
meters
long
.
 
They
set
out
from
Japan
on
May
17,2001
.
They
had
rowed
nearly
5,500
miles
when
their
boat
was
hit
by
a
fishing
ship
on
September
17,2001
.
Luckily
they
both
escaped
unharmed
,
but
their
boat
was
badly
damaged
and
they
had
to
abandon
(
=
""
stop
)
their
""
journey
.
 
In
a
radio
interview
,
Dom
expressed
his
disappointment
and
explained
how
the
accident
took
place
.
 
""
A
fishing
ship
came
towards
us
with
nobody
on
the
bridge
and
ran
us
down
.
It
all
happened
so
quickly
.
I
managed
to
dive
into
the
water
.
Tim
felt
it
would
be
safer
to
stay
on
board
.
He
was
trapped
inside
as
the
boat
was
driven
under
the
water
.
Finally
some
people
appeared
on
the
ship
and
saw
me
in
the
water
.
I
shouted
at
them
to
stop
the
ship
and
to
get
Tim
out
.
When
the
ship
stopped
,
I
eventually
saw
Tim
,
and
I
was
very
,
very
happy
that
we
were
still
alive
.
We
were
very
disappointed
that
we
could
n't
reach
San
Francisco
.
But
we
are
alive
.
That
above
everything
is
the
most
important
.

"It

under

overcome
many
challenges

its
economic

political

achieved
remarkable

As

for
a

there

"In
the
world
today
,
there
are
millions
of
surveillance
cameras
,
or
""
spy
cams
""
,
watching
and
monitoring
our
daily
activities
.
There
are
some
benefits
of
course
,
as
people
who
are
breaking
laws
can
be
watched
and
caught
using
cameras
and
this
helps
keep
our
society
and
public
places
safe
.
These
cameras
are
everywhere
and
most
are
openly
visible
on
roads
,
in
airports
,
businesses
,
shopping
centers
and
government
buildings
and
even
in
lifts
.
Even
schools
have
started
using
spy
cams
to
watch
student
activity
and
behaviour
.
 
The
cameras
are
so
common
now
that
we
hardly
ever
even
notice
them
.
But
the
problem
lies
with
the
ones
that
are
hidden
away
from
our
eyes
and
are
unseen
.
Technology
has
helped
develop
tiny
cameras
that
can
be
very
well
hidden
and
they
can
""
spy
""
on
shoppers
,
workers
,
babysitters
and
people
in
hotels
and
clubs
without
the
people
even
knowing
.
 
It
is
these
spy
cams
that
people
feel
are
an
invasion
of
privacy
.
Recently
,
in
the
US
,
there
have
been
a
number
of
court
cases
against
babysitters
whose
actions
have
been
recorded
by
their
employers
on
hidden
cameras
.
 
The
number
of
cameras
in
public
and
private
areas
is
on
the
increase
and
with
rising
crime
rates
and
the
recent
terrorist
attacks
,
more
and
more
surveillance
cameras
are
being
used
to
watch
us
.
This
means
that
we
all
have
to
be
aware
that
our
employers
,
department
stores
,
police
and
even
some
of
our
friends
could
be
spying
on
us
at
any
time

"Once
upon
a
time
,
there
was
an
island
where
all
the
feelings
lived
:
Happiness
,
Sadness
,
Knowledge
,
and
all
of
the
others
,
including
Love
.
One
day
the
feelings
were
told
that
the
island
would
sink
,
so
all
built
boats
and
left
,
except
Love
.
Love
was
the
only
one
who
stayed
.
Love
wanted
to
hold
out
until
the
last
possible
moment
.
 
When
the
island
had
almost
sunk
,
Love
decided
to
ask
for
help
.
 
Richness
was
passing
by
Love
in
a
big
boat
.
Love
said
,
""
Richness
,
can
you
take
me
with
you
?
""
 
Richness
answered
,
""
No
,
I
ca
n't
.
There
is
a
lot
of
gold
and
silver
in
my
boat
.
There
is
no
place
here
for
you
.
""
 
Love
decided
to
ask
Vanity
who
was
also
passing
by
in
a
beautiful
ship
.
""
Vanity
,
please
help
me
!
""
 
""
I
ca
n't
help
you
,
Love
.
You
are
all
wet
and
might
damage
my
boat
,
""
Vanity
answered
.
 
Sadness
was
close
by
so
Love
asked
,
""
Sadness
,
let
me
go
with
you
.
""
 
""
Oh
...
Love
,
I
am
so
sad
that
I
need
to
be
by
myself
!
""
 
Happiness
passed
by
Love
,
too
,
but
she
was
so
happy
that
she
did
not
even
hear
when
Love
called
her
.
 
Suddenly
,
there
was
a
voice
,
""
Come
,
Love
,
I
will
take
you
.
""
It
was
an
elder
.
So
thankful
and
happy
,
Love
even
forgot
to
ask
the
elder
where
they
were
going
.
When
they
arrived
at
dry
land
,
the
elder
went
her
own
way
.
Realizing
how
much
was
owed
the
elder
,
Love
asked
Knowledge
,
another
elder
,
""
Who
helped
me
?
""
 
""
It
was
Time
,
""
Knowledge
answered
.
 
""
Time
?
""
asked
Love
.
""
But
why
did
Time
help
me
?
""
 
Knowledge
smiled
with
deep
wisdom
and
answered
,
""
Because
only
Time
is
able
to
understand
how
valuable
Love
is
.

"Now
scientists
have
discovered
the
first
evidence
that
the
animals
actually
behave
like
their
masters
.
Just
like
children
,
they
adopt
a
""
look
and
learn
""
approach
which
means
they
can
mimic
human
's
actions
when
going
about
their
tasks
.
 
Biologists
and
psychologists
at
the
universities
of
Vienna
and
Oxford
designed
an
experiment
to
test
the
theory
that
dogs
do
have
the
ability
to
copy
what
they
see
,
using
a
simple
wooden
box
.
In
the
study
,
ten
owners
showed
their
dogs
how
to
open
the
wooden
box
,
sometimes
using
their
heads
to
push
a
handle
and
sometimes
using
their
hands
.
 
In
the
first
part
of
the
test
,
five
dogs
were
rewarded
with
a
piece
of
sausage
for
copying
their
owners
'
actions
.
The
other
five
were
rewarded
with
food
for
not
copying
,
and
using
other
methods
.
With
each
dog
the
experiment
was
repeated
hundreds
of
times
,
and
the
time
taken
for
a
dog
to
get
it
""
right
""
on
85
percent
of
attempts
(
17
goes
out
of
20
)
was
recorded
.
The
dogs
encouraged
to
mirror
their
owners
reached
this
point
almost
three
times
sooner
on
average
than
those
rewarded
for
not
copying
them
.
In
the
second
part
of
the
test
,
all
the
dogs
were
only
rewarded
for
copying
the
method
their
owners
used
.
The
five
dogs
previously
rewarded
for
copying
their
owners
reached
the
85
percent
mark
more
than
twice
as
the
other
five
.
 
In
a
paper
published
in
Proceeding
of
the
Royal
Society
,
they
concluded
,
""
Like
humans
,
dogs
ca
n't
help
imitating
actions
they
see
.
""
Going
further
,
they
said
,
""
The
results
suggest
the
imitative
behavior
of
dogs
is
shaped
more
by
their
developmental
interactions
with
humans
than
by
their
evolutionary
history
of
domestication
.
""
 
Caroline
Kisko
,
from
the
Kennel
club
,
said
,
""
A
dog
's
behavior
is
influenced
much
like
that
of
a
child
learning
right
from
wrong
and
adopting
similar
patterns
of
behavior
.
We
hope
that
owners
understand
the
importance
of
their
actions
and
use
this
knowledge
to
set
good
examples
and
therefore
positively
influence
the
behavior
of
their
pets
.

"A
number
of
times
Rosemary
edged
closer
to
Gordon
,
meaning
to
take
his
arm
,
but
he
edged
away
from
her
.
She
thought
that
she
had
offended
him
deeply
,
and
that
he
was
disappointed
because
she
had
pushed
him
away
.
She
would
have
apologized
if
he
had
given
her
half
a
chance
.
But
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
he
was
scarcely
thinking
of
this
any
longer
.
It
was
the
money
business
that
was
troubling
him
now
.
And
the
fact
was
that
he
would
soon
have
to
confess
it
.
What
nonsense
it
made
of
all
he
had
said
!
Presently
she
stopped
him
,
and
swung
him
round
to
face
her
.
""
Gordon
,
why
wo
n't
you
speak
to
me
?
""
she
said
.
""
Are
you
still
angry
with
me
for
what
happened
just
now
?
""
 
""
No
,
I
was
never
angry
with
you
.
You
're
not
to
blame
.
Something
else
has
been
worrying
me
all
the
way
along
,
I
've
only
eight
pence
left
.
I
had
just
enough
money
for
today
when
we
started
out
,
but
that
dinner
bill
upset
everything
.
Can
you
lend
me
some
money
?
'
 
Rosemary
was
amazed
.
""
What
does
it
matter
if
you
've
only
eight
pence
left
?
How
can
you
let
yourself
be
worried
by
a
thing
like
that
?
As
though
I
objected
to
lending
you
money
,
are
n't
I
always
telling
you
that
I
want
to
pay
for
myself
when
we
go
out
together
?
'
 
""
Yes
,
and
you
know
how
I
hate
you
paying
.
""
 
""
Oh
,
how
silly
you
are
.
""
She
said
.
""
Do
you
think
there
's
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
in
having
no
money
?
""
 
Gordon
's
face
went
bright
pink
.
""
Of
course
there
is
!
It
's
the
only
thing
in
the
world
there
is
to
be
ashamed
of
.
I
ca
n't
be
a
complete
human
being
--
I
do
n't
feel
a
human
being
-unless
I
've
got
money
in
my
pocket

"On

"If
the
crust
of
the
earth
were
not
pretty
solid
,
it
would
be
shaking
about
and
moving
up
and
down
frequently
.
However
,
there
are
places
in
the
rocks
of
the
earth
's
crust
where
it
is
n't
strongly
held
together
--
where
faults
exist
.
Along
the
faults
,
one
rock
might
push
against
another
with
great
force
.
The
energy
is
changed
to
vibration
in
the
rocks
,
so
they
begin
to
shake
and
we
have
an
earthquake
!
 
The
most
famous
one
in
North
America
was
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
of
1906
.
Seven
hundred
people
died
and
property
damage
amounted
to
about
$
425,000,000.The
greatest
destruction
came
from
the
fires
that
followed
the
quake
.
 
One
of
the
most
famous
earthquakes
in
Europe
took
place
in
Lisbon
,
Portugal
,
in
1755
.
The
city
was
destroyed
and
at
least
thirty
thousand
people
were
killed
.
In
1908
,
in
Calabria
and
Sicily
,
a
quake
killed
about
seventy-five
thousand
people
.
In
1915
,
in
central
Italy
,
hundreds
of
towns
and
villages
were
damaged
and
thirty
thousand
people
were
killed
.
 
Two
great
earthquakes
that
caused
great
damage
in
Asia
took
place
in
Tokyo
,
Japan
,
and
in
Gansu
Province
in
China
.
The
Tokyo
quake
of
1923
killed
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
people
and
destroyed
the
city
and
the
city
of
Yokohama
,
too
.
The
Chinese
quake
in
1920
covered
more
than
three
hundred
square
miles
and
killed
about
two
hundred
thousand
people

"Sometimes
it
may
seem
difficult
to
improve
our
health
.
If
so
,
the
following
health
habits
may
help
you
.
 
Eat
breakfast
every
morning
.
 
Research
shows
that
if
you
eat
a
meal
in
the
morning
you
may
not
become
too
fat
or
eat
too
much
during
lunch
.
Eating
breakfast
can
help
people
feel
better
through
the
day
.
 
Get
enough
sleep
.
 
Poor
sleep
can
influence
our
memory
and
learning
.
It
can
also
cause
traffic
accidents
!
Studies
show
that
people
who
do
n't
get
enough
sleep
seem
to
get
into
more
accidents
.
So
stay
safe
and
get
enough
sleep
!
 
Take
a
walk
every
day
.
 
Walking
is
an
easy
way
to
exercise
.
You
'd
better
meet
friends
for
a
walk
,
not
for
a
meal
.
As
you
walk
,
you
will
see
the
beautiful
world
around
you
.
Once
you
try
,
you
will
find
that
adding
a
walk
into
your
daily
life
is
very
easy
.
 
Join
social
groups
.
 
Social
groups
can
provide
support
.
They
might
include
sport
teams
,
art
or
music
groups
.
The
people
in
the
group
can
offer
advice
and
can
help
each
other
in
difficult
times
.
Also
,
being
in
a
group
keeps
your
mind
busy
.
An
active
mind
is
a
healthy
mind
!
 
Have
a
hobby
.
 
A
hobby
could
be
running
reading
or
making
something
with
your
hands
.
Hobbies
help
people
to
relax
and
rest
.
Hobbies
bring
us
joy
as
well
.

"Columbus
made
four
voyages
to
the
west
between
1492
and
1504
in
his
vain
search
for
a
sea
route
to
Asia
.
The
mystery
of
why
he
failed
to
find
it
haunted
him
and
filled
him
with
sadness
.
 
Wherever
he
went
to
Cuba
,
Puerto
Rico
,
Jamaica
,
South
America
,
Panama
,
down
the
coast
of
Central
America
--
it
was
always
the
same
story
.
Instead
of
golden
palaces
,
there
were
grass
huts
and
palm-leaf
tents
.
Instead
of
silk-robed
merchant
princes
,
he
found
""
Indians
""
who
did
not
have
so
much
as
a
shirt
on
their
backs
.
 
When
Columbus
explored
the
West
Indies
in
1493
,
he
heard
tales
of
a
fierce
Indian
tribe
who
literally
devoured
its
defeated
enemies
after
a
battle
.
These
people
were
called
by
many
names
in
the
area
,
including
Calina
,
Canima
,
Carib
,
and
Caniba
.
Columbus
recorded
the
name
of
the
American
natives
as
Canibales
in
Spanish
,
a
word
which
came
to
refer
,
within
a
few
years
,
to
any
eater
of
human
flesh
.
In
the
similar
fashion
,
the
word
Caribbean
,
a
title
for
the
sea
as
well
as
for
the
region
,
came
into
English
.
 
At
times
Columbus
knew
that
this
new
land
was
not
China
,
not
Japan
,
not
the
Spice
Islands
.
He
seemed
to
accept
it
as
a
part
of
the
earth
that
the
geographers
of
Europe
had
never
heard
of
before
.
It
was
another
world
--
and
he
called
it
exactly
that
--
but
Columbus
also
insisted
until
he
died
that
land
he
had
reached
was
an
unknown
part
of
Asia

"Earthquakes
are
something
that
people
fear
.
There
are
some
places
that
have
few
or
no
earthquakes
.
Most
places
in
the
world
,
however
,
have
them
regularly
.
Countries
that
have
a
lot
of
earthquakes
are
usually
quite
mountainous
.
 
The
most
talked
about
earthquake
in
the
United
States
was
in
San
Francisco
in
1906
.
Over
700
people
died
in
it
.
The
strongest
one
in
North
America
was
in
1964
.
It
happened
in
Alaska
.
 
Strong
earthquakes
are
not
always
the
ones
that
kill
the
most
people
.
In
1755
,
one
of
the
strongest
earthquakes
ever
recorded
was
felt
in
Portugal
.
Around
2,000
people
died
.
In
1923
,
a
very
strong
earthquake
hit
Tokyo
,
the
Yokohama
area
of
Japan
.
A
hundred
and
forty
thousand
people
died
.
Most
of
them
died
in
fires
which
followed
the
earthquake
.
 
One
of
the
worst
earthquakes
ever
was
in
China
in
1976
.
It
killed
a
large
number
of
people
.
The
worst
earthquake
ever
recorded
was
also
in
China
,
in
which
400,000
people
were
killed
or
injured
.
This
earthquake
happened
in
1556
.
 
Earthquakes
worry
people
a
lot
.
The
reason
is
that
we
often
do
not
know
when
they
are
coming
.
People
can
not
prepare
for
it
.
Although
we
can
not
stop
earthquakes
,
there
are
things
which
can
be
done
to
protect
ourselves
during
an
earthquake

"Knowing
about
yourself
means
not
only
that
you
find
out
what
you
're
good
at
and
what
you
like
,
it
also
means
discovering
what
you
're
not
good
at
and
what
you
do
n't
like
.
Both
help
you
to
see
your
aim
in
life
.
 
Although
most
students
would
be
unhappy
if
they
found
that
they
had
failed
a
very
difficult
physics
examination
,
they
have
in
fact
learned
a
lot
about
themselves
.
They
know
that
they
should
not
become
engineers
or
physical
scientists
.
So
failing
can
help
a
student
to
live
a
much
happier
life
if
he
or
she
draws
something
out
of
the
failing
.
They
may
then
decide
on
their
aims
and
choose
the
kind
of
work
they
would
be
fit
for
and
they
would
like
to
do
.
 
It
is
impossible
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
like
something
until
you
have
tried
it
.
If
you
decide
that
you
would
like
to
play
the
piano
,
you
need
to
take
more
than
one
lesson
before
you
can
know
whether
you
are
really
interested
in
it
or
you
are
able
to
do
well
.
It
is
not
enough
to
want
to
be
 
a
great
pianist
.
You
also
have
to
like
the
hard
practice
and
long
training
before
you
become
one
.
If
you
would
enjoy
being
a
great
pianist
but
hate
the
work
,
forget
it
.
 
It
's
a
good
plan
to
try
as
many
ideas
as
possible
when
you
are
still
young
.
And
then
you
will
be
able
to
find
out
what
your
true
interests
are

"In
1969
I
was
a
young
girl
working
in
Toronto
.
I
was
from
a
small
town
in
Ontario
and
had
just
moved
to
the
big
city
about
three
months
earlier
.
It
was
one
week
before
Christmas
and
I
was
going
home
on
the
last
streetcar
of
the
evening
.
 
I
remember
looking
at
my
paycheque
and
asking
myself
how
it
was
going
to
endure
.
At
that
time
in
my
life
I
hardly
had
enough
money
to
exist
on
.
Bread
for
supper
and
oatmeal
for
breakfast
was
the
only
way
I
kept
hunger
at
bay
.
 
I
got
off
the
streetcar
and
started
walking
up
the
street
,
when
I
suddenly
noticed
a
man
was
running
after
me
.
I
stopped
,
turned
around
,
seeing
that
he
was
black
.
I
""
snapped
""
,
""
What
do
you
want
?
""
The
man
answered
in
a
soft
voice
,
""
I
am
returning
your
wallet
.
You
left
it
on
the
streetcar
seat
.
""
 
Because
of
that
man
's
thoughtfulness
,
I
was
allowed
the
comfort
of
going
home
by
bus
for
the
summer
holidays
.
Otherwise
,
I
would
have
stayed
alone
in
my
small
room
with
a
hog
plate
.
 
I
have
never
been
so
ashamed
of
myself
,
and
that
poor
,
kind
man
had
to
walk
,
who
knows
how
far
,
home
.
 
I
recognized
immediately
that
this
was
wrong
of
me
and
it
changed
my
ways
forever

"These
days
people
more
and
more
care
for
their
weight
.
For
example
,
as
many
as
70,000,000
Americans
are
perhaps
on
weight-
reducing
diets
,
and
weight
control
has
become
very
large
business
.
 
There
are
different
kinds
of
diet
foods
in
the
markets
such
as
soft
drinks
,
diet
cakes
,
diet
salad
dressings
.
Dieters
also
spend
much
money
on
diet
pills
,
exercise
machines
and
so
on
.
Each
year
scores
of
new
diets
become
popular
all
over
America
.
they
have
such
names
as
the
Miracle
Diet
,
the
Nine
-Day
Wonder
diet
,
and
the
Easy
24-
Hour
Diet
.
There
is
even
one
called
the
Ice
Cream
diet
,
which
advises
the
dieter
to
eat
only
ice
cream
for
lunch
and
dinner
!
For
dieters
who
can
not
lose
weight
on
their
own
,
there
are
many
well-prepared
diet
groups
,
which
give
their

"There
are
two
main
kinds
of
sports
.
These
two
kinds
of
sports
are
team
sports
and
individual
sports
.
Team
sports
are
such
sports
as
baseball
,
basketball
,
and
volleyball
.
Team
sports
need
two
separate
teams
.
The
teams
play
against
each
other
.
They
compete
against
each
other
to
get
the
best
score
.
For
example
,
in
a
football
game
,
if
team
A
gets
8
points
and
team
B
gets
4
points
,
team
A
wins
the
game
.
Team
sports
are
sometimes
called
competitive
sports
.
 
Another
kind
of
sports
is
individual
sports
.
In
individual
sports
there
are
no
teams
.
There
is
n't
any
competition
.
People
play
individual
sports
in
order
to
get
some
exercise
,
not
to
win
a
game
.
Individual
sports
are
such
sports
as
swimming
,
skiing
,
and
running
.
 
Of
course
,
it
is
possible
to
compete
in
individual
sports
.
It
is
possible
to
keep
a
score
in
individual
sports
.
The
main
difference
,
however
,
between
team
sports
and
individual
sports
is
that
individual
sports
can
be
finished
alone
.
But
team
sports
always
need
more
than
one
person
.

-
Unknown
armed
men
in
military
uniform
kidnapped
three
staff
of
the
United
Nations
in
the
Afghan
capital
city
at
broad
daylight
Thursday

Afghan
officials
confirmed

""
Three
armed
men
in

intercepted
a

car
in

area
ofprefix

/Kabulcity
early
afternoon
and
took
away
three
persons
including
two
women
with
them
,
""
Rohullah
,
a
witness
at
the
site
told
Xinhua
.
 
The
kidnappers
also
badly
beat
up
the
Afghan
driver
of
the
UN
car
,
added
Rohullah
who
is
a
lorry
driver
in
the
city
.
The
area
has
been
watched
over
by
UN
guards
.
 
UN
officials
as
well
as
Afghan
confirmed
the
incident
but
refused
to
provide
further
information
.
The
three
kidnapped
,
according
to
some
officials
,
who
are
from
Britain
,
Ireland
and
Kosovo
,
were
working
for
the
UN-sponsored
Joint
Electoral
Management
Body
(
JEMB
)
overseeing
the
first
presidential
elections
held
on
Oct.9
across
Afghanistan
and
in
Iran
and
Pakistan
.
 
This
is
the
first
time
that
such
an
incident
has
taken
place
in
the
Afghan
capital
over
the
last
three
years
 
So
far
,
no
one
has
claimed
responsibility
for
the
kidnapping
.
However
,
remnants
of
the
former
Taliban
regime
who
failed
to
stop
the
great
presidential
elections
have
promised
to
continue
holy
war
until
the
US-led
troops
leave
Afghanistan

"I
do
n't
want
to
upset
you

but
nobody
can
ever
find
out
what
day
is
going
to
be
the
last
.
And
so
it
's
better
to
live
each
day
of
your
life
as
if
it
is
the
last
.
I
'm
not
telling
you
to
quit
your
job

spend
all
your
money
on
traveling
.
But
you
can
live
your
life

its
fullest
by
adding
some
simple
things
to
each
day
.
It
does
n't
matter
what
is
going
on
,
but
it
does
matter
how
you
feel
about
it
.
Here
is
my
recipe
for
the
best
day
on
Earth
!
 
A
Handful
of
Happiness
 
Where

it
is
within
you
.
Each
moment
your
life
gives
you
a
lot
of
opportunities
to
be
happy
.
If
you
want
to
see
them
,
you
will
.
If
you
do
n't
,
it
's
up
to
you
.
 
A
Handful
of
Love
 
Love
is
the
harmony
of
your
soul
.
A
little
love
can
make
a
big
difference
to
the
whole
world
.
We
are
one
.
Everyone
and
everything
deserve
your
love
as
well
as
you
do
.
 
A
Handful
of
Dreams
 
Feel
free
to
dream
big
dreams
and
make
small
steps
towards
them
.
You
are
the
creator
of
your
life
.
Every
time
you
are
doing
something
to
achieve
your
goals
you
are
growing
.
 
A
Handful
of
Creativity
 
Try
to
be
creative
in
everything
you
do
.

to
do
your
best
every
time
you
are
doing
something
.
Do
not
be
afraid
to
use
your
imagination
.
It
's
such
a
pleasure
to
do
something
new
.
Feel
the
joy
of
creation
!
 
A

of
Magic
 
Do
you
believe

magic
?
Well
,
you
should
.
Life
is
full
of
miracles
.
In
fact
,
life
itself
is
a
big
miracle
.
There
are
so
many
things
that
are
beyond
our
understanding
.

"Becoming
more
popular
in
North
America
is
Iceberg
Water
,
which
is
harvested
from
icebergs
off
the
coast
of
Newfoundland
,
Canada
.
 
Arthur
von
Wiesenberger
is
one
of
the
few
water
critics
in
North
America
.
As
a
boy
,
he
spent
time
in
the
larger
cities
of
Italy
,
France
and
Switzerland
,
where
bottled
water
is
consumed
daily
.
Even
then
,
he
kept
a
record
of
the
brands
he
liked
best
.
""
My
dog
could
tell
the
difference
between
bottled
and
tap
water
,
""
He
says
.
 
But
is
plain
tap
water
all
that
bad
?
Not
at
all
.
In
fact
.
New
York
's
drinking
water
for
more
than
a
century
was
called
the
champagne
of
tap
water
and
until
recently
considered
among
the
best
in
the
world
in
terms
of
both
taste
and
purity
.
Similarly
,
a
magazine
in
England
found
that
tap
water
from
the
Thames
River
tasted
better
than
several
leading
brands
of
bottled
water
that
were
400
times
more
expensive
.
 
However
,
soft-drink
companies
view
bottled
water
as
the
next
battle-ground
for
market
share
,
as
bottlers
and
restaurateurs
are
longing
for
the
profits
from
it
.
A
restaurant
's
typical
mark-up
on
wine
is
100
to
150
percent
,
while
on
bottled
water
it
's
often
300
to
500
percent
.
As
a
result
,
some
restaurants
are
trying
to
sell
more
bottled
water
.
Some
of
the
more
shameless
tactics
include
putting
attractive
bottles
on
the
table
for
a
visual
sell
,
listing
brands
on
the
menu
without
prices
,
and
pouring
bottled
water
without
even
asking
the
diners
whether
they
want
it
.
 
Regardless
of
how
it
's
sold
,
the
popularity
of
bottled
water
taps
into
our
desire
for
better
health
,
our
wish
to
appear
educated
,
and
even
a
longing
for
lost
purity
."	"1

"Wang
Chuanfu
,
chairman
of
BYD
Co.
,
Ltd.
,
was
named
China
's
richest
individual
this
week
by
Forbes
magazine
,
which
stated
his
wealth
is
worth
$
5.8
billion
.
 
Wang
grew
up
in
a
poor
family
in
Anhui
Province
and
had
lost
his
parents
for
illness
when
he
was
a
teenager
.
He
went
to
college
only
after
the
encouragement
and
support
of
his
older
siblings
,
who
also
helped
him
.
 
""
I
was
born
on
a
rice
farm
very
,
very
poor
,
""
Wang
told
The
Wall
Street
Journal
in
an
interview
last
year
.
""
Both
of
my
parents
were
farmers
and
they
planted
rice
.
Both
passed
away
when
I
was
still
very
young
.
I
was
about
10
years
old
when
my
father
died
,
and
I
was
15
or
so
when
my
mother
passed
away
.
""
 
He
developed
a
fascination
with
batteries
back
in
his
university
days
in
the
mid-1980s
,
when
he
studied
metallurgical
physics
and
chemistry
.
After
receiving
a
Master
's
degree
,
he
found
a
research
position
at
the
General
Research
Institute
for
Nonferrous
Metals
in
Beijing
.
It
was
an
easy
job
,
but
he
grew
bored
and
decided
to
go
out
on
his
own
just
as
China
's
experiment
with
capitalism
was
going
on
.
 
He
established
the
company
that
is
now
BYD
in
1995
,
borrowing
$
300,000
from
a
cousin
,
and
started
out
making
batteries
for
cellphones
.
Today
,
the
company
still
makes
phone
batteries
but
also
produces
gasoline-
fueled
cars
that
have
made
BYD
a
top-10
auto
brand
in
China
.
 
The
company
,
listed
on
the
Hong
Kong
Stock
Exchange
since
2002
,
is
also
getting
ready
to
sell
electric
cars
to
private
buyers
and
launch
an
all-electric
battery
car
model
soon
in
China
.
All
this
has
helped
BYD
attract
investors
'
attention
,
including
from
one
of
Warren
Buffett
's
companies
,
and
has
helped
enrich
Wang
as
BYD
's
share
price
has
increased
.
 
Wang
's
fast
climb
shows
personal
struggle
is
still
working
in
China
even
as
the
country
faces
widening
gaps
between
the
haves
and
the
have-nots
.
 
""
Because
I
came
from
a
poor
background
,
I
knew
the
only
way
for
me
to
get
ahead
was
to
get
good
education
.
I
studied
very
hard
.

"For
most
of
us
,
the
rain
that
falls
on
our
roof
runs
off
into
the
ground
or
the
sewer
system
.
But
if
you
want
to
save
a
little
water
and
reuse
it
on
your
lawns
or
plants
--
-
or
even
use
it
for
laundry
,
dishes
,
or
other
needs
--
-
collecting
rainwater
from
your
gutter
's
downspouts
is
a
no-brainer
 
According
to
John
C.
Davis
,
writing
in
E
/
The
Environmental
Magazine
,
just
about
any
homeowner
can
collect
rainwater
,
given
that
the
roof
and
gutters
do
most
of
the
work
.
And
since
an
inch
of
rain
falling
on
a
2,000-square-foot
roof
produces
some
1,200
gallons
of
water
,
you
can
harvest
enough
to
water
your
lawn
or
garden
.
 
Plants
and
grass
actually
do
better
when
fed
rainwater
instead
of
tap
water
,
which
is
usually
treated
with
substances
that
can
hold
back
plant
growth
.
Using
rainwater
can
also
extend
the
life
of
pipes
,
since
the
salts
added
to
tap
water
may
gradually
damage
the
pipes
.
However
,
homeowners
should
set
up
a
water
purification
system
if
they
do
plan
to
use
rainwater
for
inside
needs
.
 
Rainwater
harvesting
can
also
be
good
for
the
local
community
,
as
it
reduces
the
erosion
,
flooding
,
and
pollution
associated
with
heavy
rainfall
,
and
reduces
dependence
on
public
water
supplies
.
So
some
states
fund
rainwater
collection
systems
in
their
local
communities
.
 
Many
varieties
of
rain
barrel
systems
,
starting
at
just
$
100
,
are
available
for
home
use
.
A
typical
setup
is
simply
a
rain
barrel
positioned
under
a
gutter
's
downspout
.
Skillful
homeowners
can
make
their
own
water
harvesting
systems
,
but
buying
one
is
a
lot
easier
.
Most
garden
centres
offer
a
range
of
choices
as
well
as
tips
."	"314

"A
long
time
ago
there
were
no
donkeys
in
Gui
Zhou
.
One
day
a
merchant
from
another
part
of
the
country
went
there
and
took
a
donkey
with
him
.
Later
the
donkey
got
sick
and
the
merchant
left
it
behind
and
went
on
his
journey
.
When
the
donkey
was
well
again
,
it
ran
away
into
the
nearby
forest
.
 
The
tigers
in
the
forest
thought
that
the
donkey
was
a
strange
animal
and
they
were
afraid
of
it
.
Whenever
it
brayed
they
all
ran
away
as
fast
as
their
feet
could
carry
them
.
 
After
a
few
months
,
the
tigers
became
friendly
with
the
donkey
.
They
played
many
games
with
it
,
but
they
still
afraid
of
it
.
 
One
day
the
donkey
became
angry
.
It
kicked
one
of
the
tigers
with
its
hind
legs
.
The
tigers
were
very
surprised
.
 
""
That
must
be
all
it
can
do
when
it
is
angry
.
""
They
said
.
Then
all
the
tigers
jumped
on
the
donkey
and
killed
it

since

when
Intermountain

(

began

in

Today
,
tens

teams
-
dogs

their
owners
-
volunteer
to
spend
time
with
youngsters
in
schools
and
libraries
across
the
United
States
and
around
the
world
.
The
idea
is
that
sharing
a
book
with
a
nonjudgmental
partner
encourages
students
'
confidence
and
helps
develop
a
love
of
reading
.
 
Izzy
,
a
Havanese
therapy
dog
,
is
a
regular
visitor
to
Public
School
57
in
East
Harlem
,
New
York
.
Students
meet
him
in
the
library
,
pick
out
a
book
and
sit
down
on
the
carpet
.
Izzy
snuggles
up
to
them
and
gets
ready
to
hear
a
story
.
 
""
I
love
reading
to
Izzy
because
he
listens
to
me
,
and
he
does
n't
make
fun
of
me
when
I
make
a
mistake
,
""
says
third-grader
Aelane
Vasquez
.
The
9-year-old
,
whose
parents
are
from
Mexico
,
is
one
of
15
Latin-American
students
at
the
school
who
were
selected
for
the
program
.
 
""
All
the
students
that
we
work
with
in
the
R.E.A.D
.
program
were
behind
reading
levels
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
""
Bridget
McElroy
,
who
teaches
English
as
a
Second
Language
,
explained
.
""
Now
most
of
them
have
reached
the
average
level
,
if
not
above
it
.
""
That
's
important
,
because
achieving
proficiency
in
reading
is
vital
for
kids
to
succeed
.
Studies
have
shown
that
students
who
ca
n't
read
at
grade
level
by
the
end
of
third
grade
are
four
times
less
likely
to
graduate
high

age

McElroy
said
she
sees
a
marked
difference
in
Aelane
and
her
classmates
,
and
not
just
in
study
.
""
Not
only
do
the
kids
have
time
to
practice
reading
,
what
we
are
really
seeing
is
that
they
are
excited
to
read
and
practice
even
when

not

"There
was
once
a
lonely
girl
who
longed
so
much
for
love
.
One
day
while
she
was
walking
in
the
woods
she
found
two
starving
songbirds
.
She
took
them
home
and
put
them
in
a
small
cage
,
caring
them
with
love
.
Luckily
,
the
birds
grew
strong
little
by
little
.
Every
morning
they
greeted
her
with
a
wonderful
song
.
The
girl
felt
great
love
for
the
birds
.
 
One
day
the
girl
left
the
door
to
the
cage
open
accidentally
.
The
larger
and
stronger
of
the
two
birds
flew
from
the
cage
.
The
girl
was
so
frightened
that
he
would
fly
away
so
as
he
flew
close
,
she
grasped
him
wildly
.
Her
heart
felt
glad
at
her
success
in
capturing
him
.
Suddenly
,
she
felt
the
bird
go
limp
,
so
she
opened
her
hand
and
stared
in
horror
at
the
dead
bird
.
It
was
her
desperate
love
that
had
killed
him
.
 
She
noticed
the
other
bird
moving
back
and
forth
on
the
edge
of
the
cage
.
She
could
feel
his
strong
desire-needing
to
fly
into
the
clear
,
blue
sky
.
Unwillingly
,
she
lifted
him
from
the
cage
and
tossed
him
softly
into
the
air
.
The
lucky
bird
circled
once
,
twice
,
three
times
.
 
The
girl
watched
delightedly
at
the
bird
.
Her
heart
was
no
longer
concerned
with
her
loss
.
What
she
wanted
to
see
was
that
the
bird
could
fly
happily
.
Suddenly
the
bird
flew
closer
and
landed
softly
on
her
shoulder
.
It
sang
the
sweetest
tune
that
she
had
ever
heard
.
 
Remember
,
the
fastest
way
to
lose
love
is
to
hold
on
it
too
tight
;
the
best
way
to
keep
love
is
to
give
it
wings

"Dear
Water
--
Use
It
Wisely
,
 
More
and
more
water
is
getting
wasted
each
day
.
I
want
to
help
out
and
teach
people
how
to
conserve
water
.
Please
continue
reading
because
your
organization
is
very
influential
.
I
had
an
idea
that
you
could
send
some
workers
from
your
organization
to
schools
all
around
the
world
,
and
they
could
inform
the
students
about
water
usage
.
 
Did
you
know
that
every
minute
,
1,000,000,000
(
one
billion
)
tons
of
water
falls
to
the
earth
from
rain
?
We
are
lucky
to
have
rainwater
.
It
helps
fill
up
our
lakes
.
There
is
about
326,000,000,000,000,000,000
gallons
of
water
on
Earth
.
Yes
,
this
is
tons
,
but
it
is
getting
wasted
.
 
Everyone
needs
water
.
So
why
waste
it
?
I
think
it
is
very
irresponsible
to
let
the
water
run
when
you
are
not
at
home
.
We
can
use
water
with
respect
by
making
good
choices
.
Take
a
shower
instead
of
a
bath
,
use
an
automatic
dishwasher
instead
of
hand
washing
.
You
can
buy
Earthfriendly
cleaner
spray
,
so
that
our
drinking
water
will
not
be
polluted
.
If
your
washer
is
n't
full
,
then
do
n't
start
it
.
With
water
being
wasted
every
day
,
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
3000s
we
are
going
to
have
to
survive
on
milk
and
juice
!
Wo
n't
that
be
boring
?
That
means
we
will
have
to
give
our
dogs
a
bowl
of
juice
instead
of
water
with
their
food
.
I
mean
,
come
on
,
we
're
talking
real
life
here
!
 
Water
wasting
needs
to
come
to
a
stop
and
without
delay
.
Water-Use
It
Wisely
,
PLEASE
inform
people
about
their
water
usage
!
It
plays
a
big
role
in
my
life
.
It
would
be
really
great
if
you
take
part
in
spreading
the
news
about
this
!
Thanks
tons
!

"3D
cinema
has
been
around
since
the
early
20th
century
,
but
Hollywood
brought
the
technology
back
In
2007
.
Many
thought
it
was
just
a
trick
to
make
more
money
.
But
then
came
Avatar
,
the
first
must-see
movie
in
3D
.
 
But
since
Avatar
,
3D
cinema
has
struggled
.
In
2010
,
several
3D
movies
bombed
at
the
box
office
.
And
by
late
2010
,
Some
people
said
the
technology
was
dead
.
Of
course
,
this
is
n't
the
first
time
Hollywood
has
struggled
with
new
technology
.
Although
sound
was
added
to
movies
in
the
late
1920s
,
it
took
audiences
time
to
get
used
to
the
new
technology
.
But
in
the
end
,
sound
and
color
became
the
standard
.
James
Cameron
,
director
of
Avatar
,
thinks
we
're
going
through
the
same
process
with
3D
.
 
Some
say
cinemas
are
charging
too
much
for
3D
movies
.
In
the
US
,
seeing
a
3D
movie
can
cost
up
to
$
7.5
more
than
seeing
it
in
2D
.
Also
,
a
recent
study
at
California
State
University
found
audiences
do
n't
actually
enjoy
movies
in
3D
any
more
than
in
2D
.
Walter
Murch
,
a
famous
movie
editor
,
wrote
in
2011
that
human
beings
have
no
ability
to
process
3D
images
.
Watching
a
3D
movie
confuses
our
brain
and
this
is
why
some
people
get
headaches
.
 
But
James
Cameron
disagrees
.
In
fact
,
he
recently
predicted
that
in
five
years
all
movies
will
be
in
3D
.
And
there
are
signs
that
3D
is
fighting
back
.
More
3D
movies
were
put
on
the
market
in
2012
than
ever
before
.
The
Lion
King
3D
recently
made
over
US
$
150
million
at
the
box
office
,
and
Cameron
's
Titanic
3D
made
even
more
.
 
Who
knows
what
the
future
holds
for
3D
?
Steven
Spielberg
recently
said
,
'Tm
hoping
3D
gets
to
a
point
where
people
dorft
notice
it
.
Because
then
it
just
becomes
another
tool
and
helps
tell
a
story
.

"On
a
hot
July
afternoon
,
my
mother
and
I
were
walking
back
home
from
a
pizza
store
.
We
had
bought
many
things
.
I
was
feeling
really
tired
as
I
was
carrying
our
shopping
bag
.
I
decided
to
throw
something
away
.
I
was
walking
towards
a
dustbin
when
I
noticed
a
poor
man
walking
out
of
the
restaurant
in
front
of
us
.
He
walked
to
the
nearby
dustbin
and
started
looking
through
it
.
 
I
suddenly
felt
very
sorry
because
I
was
going
to
throw
away
a
new
drink
just
because
it
was
too
heavy
.
I
walked
up
to
him
and
gave
the
drink
and
some
bread
to
him
,
which
surprised
him
.
The
man
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
took
what
I
gave
him
.
A
big
smile
appeared
on
his
face
.
I
felt
I
couldn`t
be
happier
with
myself
.
But
then
he
said
.
""
Wow
,
this
is
my
son
's
lucky
day
!
""
 
With
that
,
he
thanked
me
happily
and
started
off
on
his
bike
.
I
even
heard
him
singing
as
he
rode
away
.
I
got
a
warm
feeling
inside
.
I
now
understand
what
it
means
by
the
saying
""
Giving
in
getting
.
""
 
Though
it
was
only
a
little
action
,
I
got
and
learned
more
in
those
two
minutes
than
I
did
in
the
rest
of
the
month
.
Everyone
in
the
world
needs
help
.
Everyone
can
give
help
and
everyone
can
be
helped
.
 
The
look
of
the
man`s
happiness
appears
in
my
mind
whenever
I
have
the
chance
to
do
something
nice

"Now
scientists
believe
that
global
warming
affects
hibernating
animals
,
causing
them
to
wake
up
earlier
.
While
this
may
seem
a
little
concern
,
it
is
in
fact
a
serious
environmental
problem
.
The
shortened
hibernation
period
could
actually
lead
to
significant
decreases
in
the
population
of
several
species
.
 
Some
of
the
first
evidence
of
the
problem
came
from
Colorado
,
where
researchers
at
the
Rocky
Mountain
Biological
Lab
have
been
observing
marmot
hibernation
behavior
since
the
1970s
.
In
the
early
days
of
their
studies
,
marmots
generally
hibernated
several
weeks
into
the
month
of
May
.
Nowadays
,
however
,
temperatures
in
the
area
have
risen
by
2.5
degrees
Fahrenheit
,
and
the
marmots
wake
up
about
a
month
earlier
.
 
At
least
the
marmots
are
still
hibernating
.
Several
other
animals
have
not
been
hibernating
at
all
recently
.
Brown
bears
in
the
Spanish
Cantabrian
Mountains
did
not
hibernate
last
year
.
Chipmunks
in
the
US
and
some
snakes
in
Australia
also
skipped
the
hibernation
period
.
The
bears
seem
to
have
survived
without
losing
many
individuals
.
The
chipmunks
and
snakes
,
however
,
were
not
so
lucky
.
Many
of
the
animals
died
of
starvation
during
the
winter
.
 
The
problem
with
animals
waking
up
early
,
or
skipping
hibernation
altogether
,
lies
with
the
creatures
'
metabolism
.
When
the
animals
hibernate
,
their
metabolism
drops
significantly
.
The
animals
'
heart
rate
slows
,
and
they
require
very
little
energy
to
live
.
When
the
animals
awake
in
the
spring
,
their
metabolism
returns
to
normal
.
 
But
while
their
metabolism
may
be
as
active
as
it
was
before
hibernation
,
food
sources
are
n't
as
available
as
they
were
before
.
A
marmot
may
wake
up
when
temperatures
get
warmer
,
thinking
it
's
spring
,
but
plants
will
not
have
got
the
amount
of
sun
they
need
to
grow
.
So
until
the
plants
grow
,
the
marmots
have
no
reliable
food
source
.
 
Many
scientists
believe
the
problem
will
continue
to
get
worse
.
For
many
biologists
,
that
's
a
scary
prospect
.
Terry
Root
,
an
animal
expert
at
Stanford
University
,
said
,
""
I
do
think
what
we
will
be
facing
is
the
extinction
of
many
species
.

"Dear
residents
of
Molten
,
 
We
ca
n't
keep
silent
in
the
current
wild
situation
when
prices
for
all
existing
products
are
skyrocketing
unbelievably
.
The
enormous
figures
on
price
tags
for
food
products
have
caused
a
real
panic
.
We
've
perfectly
realized
that
,
and
that
's
why
we
have
kept
bread
prices
affordable
for
all
this
time
.
 
At
the
moment
all
our
reserves
are
exhausted
.
Stocks
of
bread-baking
ingredients
such
as
flour
,
sugar
,
butter
and
the
like
are
running
out
.
To
buy
what
we
need
at
reasonable
prices
is
virtually
impossible
today
.
 
However
,
we
all
need
bread
every
day
,
which
means
we
will
be
forced
to
buy
everything
we
need
at
much
higher
prices
.
 
The
cost
of
bread
closely
depends
on
ingredients
.
Another
financial
crisis
has
led
to
a
300-percent
increase
of
prices
for
butter
,
vegetable
oil
and
others
as
of
September
1
.
All
these
prices
continue
to
grow
every
hour
.
 
We
have
to
take
any
possible
measures
which
will
help
Figaro
contain
the
growth
of
prices
for
its
products
.
Despite
of
our
SOS
signal
,
no
measures
have
been
taken
as
yet
.
We
have
found
ourselves
in
the
same
situation
as
any
of
you
.
We
see
the
situation
changing
steadily
for
the
worse
.
We
will
not
cope
with
that
alone
.
 
Because
of
this
,
Figaro
came
to
the
critical
point
where
it
is
necessary
to
raise
prices
of
its
products
.
We
see
one
recourse
(
way
)
:
raise
the
bread
price
minimally
and
cancel
our
free
plastic
bag
service
.
But
what
is
next
?
This
is
the
concern
of
all
the
700
employees
and
the
board
of
Figaro
.
 
Every
extra
cent
in
the
cost
of
bread
upsets
you
and
us
very
much
.
Making
our
sincere
apologies
for
a
forced
increase
of
the
bread
price
,
we
hope
for
your
understanding
and
support
.
Today
and
tomorrow
we
are
with
you
,
as
usual
.
 
The
staff
and
board
of
Figaro"	"1

"Street
art
can
be
found
on
buildings
,
sidewalks
,
street
signs
and
even
trash
cans
from
Tokyo
to
Paris
to
New
York
City
.
This
special
kind
of
art
can
take
the
form
of
paintings
,
sculptures
,
cloth
or
even
stickers
.
Street
art
has
become
part
of
a
global
visual
culture
.
Now
,
even
art
museums
and
galleries
are
collecting
the
work
of
street
artists
.
 
It
is
not
easy
to
provide
an
exact
history
of
the
street
art
movement
.
This
kind
of
art
has
developed
in
many
kinds
of
ways
in
places
all
over
the
world
.
Also
,
because
it
is
illegal
to
paint
public
and
private
property
without
permission
,
street
artists
usually
work
secretly
.
This
secretive
nature
of
street
art
and
its
countless
forms
make
it
hard
to
define
exactly
.
And
people
have
different
opinions
about
the
movement
.
Some
think
street
art
is
a
crime
and
destroys
property
.
But
others
see
this
art
as
a
rich
form
of
non-traditional
cultural
expression
.
Many
experts
say
the
movement
began
in
New
York
City
in
the
nineteen
sixties
.
Young
adults
would
use
paint
in
special
cans
to
spray
their
TAG
on
walls
and
train
cars
around
the
city
.
This
tag
was
a
name
they
created
to
identify
themselves
and
their
artwork
.
This
colorful
style
of
writing
is
also
called
graffiti
.
It
is
visually
exciting
and
energetic
.
 
Graffiti
also
became
a
separate
movement
expressing
the
street
culture
of
young
people
living
in
big
cities
.
Graffiti
art
represented
social
and
political
rebellion
.
These
artists
could
travel
around
areas
of
the
city
making
creative
paintings
for
everyone
to
see
.
Sometimes
this
street
art
created
a
dispute
between
artists
and
city
officials
.
Graffiti
artists
created
their
images
and
city
officials
quickly
painted
over
them
.
During
the
1980s
,
two
famous
New
York
painters
--
Keith
Haring
and
Jean
Michel
began
showing
their
work
in
art
galleries
and
museums
.
This
is
when
street
art
started
to
become
part
of
the
more
general
popular
culture

"One
year
our
family
decided
to
have
a
special
celebration
of
Mother
's
Day
,
as
a
token
of
appreciations
for
all
the
sacrifices
that
Mother
had
made
for
us
.
After
breakfast
we
had
arranged
,
as
a
surprise
,
to
hire
a
car
and
take
her
for
a
beautiful
drive
in
the
country
.
Mother
was
rarely
able
to
have
a
treat
like
that
,
because
she
was
busy
in
the
house
nearly
all
the
time
.
 
But
on
the
very
morning
of
the
day
,
we
changed
the
plan
a
little
,
because
it
occurred
to
Father
that
it
would
be
even
better
to
take
Mother
fishing
.
As
the
car
was
hired
and
paid
for
,
we
might
as
well
use
it
to
drive
up
into
the
hills
where
the
streams
are
.
As
Father
said
,
if
you
just
go
driving
without
object
,
you
have
a
sense
of
aimlessness
,
but
if
you
are
going
to
fish
there
is
a
definite
purpose
that
heightens
the
enjoyment
.
 
So
we
all
felt
it
would
be
nicer
for
Mother
to
have
a
definite
purpose
.
Father
had
just
got
a
fishing
rod
the
day
before
,
which
he
said
mother
could
use
if
she
wanted
to
.
Only
Mother
said
she
would
much
rather
watch
him
fish
than
try
to
fish
herself
.
 
So
we
got
her
to
make
up
a
sandwich
lunch
in
case
we
got
hungry
,
though
we
were
to
come
home
again
to
a
big
festive
dinner
.
 
Well
,
when
the
car
came
to
the
door
,
it
turned
out
that
there
was
not
as
much
space
in
it
as
we
had
supposed
.
It
was
plain
that
we
could
n't
all
get
in
.
 
Father
said
that
he
could
just
stay
home
and
put
in
the
time
working
in
the
garden
.
He
said
that
there
was
a
lot
of
rough
dirty
work
that
he
could
do
,
like
digging
a
trench
for
the
garbage
,
which
would
save
hiring
a
man
,
and
so
he
said
that
he
'd
stay
home
;
he
said
that
we
were
not
to
let
the
fact
that
he
had
not
had
a
real
holiday
for
three
years
stand
in
our
way
.
He
wanted
us
to
go
right
ahead
and
not
to
mind
him
.
 
But
of
course
we
all
felt
that
it
would
never
do
to
let
Father
stay
home
,
especially
as
we
knew
he
would
make
trouble
if
he
did
.
The
two
girls
,
Anne
and
Mary
,
would
have
stayed
and
helped
the
maid
get
dinner
,
only
it
seemed
such
a
pity
,
for
the
two
girls
were
eager
to
show
their
new
hats
on
a
lovely
day
like
this
.
But
they
said
that
Mother
had
only
to
say
the
word
and
they
'd
gladly
stay
home
and
work
.
Will
and
I
would
have
dropped
out
,
but
unfortunately
we
would
n't
have
been
any
use
in
preparing
the
dinner

"Engineers
should
embrace
the
arts
,
Sir
John
O'Reilly
,
a
fellow
of
the
Institution
of
Engineering
and
Technology
,
argued
in
a
lecture
.
 
About
59
%
of
engineering
companies
in
the
IET
's
2014
survey
feared
skill
shortages
could
threaten
business
.
 
""
There
is
nothing
as
creative
as
engineering
,
""
Sir
John
told
the
reporter
.
He
says
science
,
technology
,
engineering
and
mathematics
-
often
known
as
""
Stem
""
subjects
,
are
vital
for
a
modern
knowledge
economy
.
But
there
is
a
massive
shortfall
in
the
number
of
recruits
-
with
a
recent
study
by
the
Royal
Academy
of
Engineering
saying
the
UK
needs
to
increase
by
as
much
as
50
%
the
number
of
Stem
graduates
it
produces
.
 
Delivering
this
year
's
Mountbatten
Lecture
at
the
Royal
Institution
,
Sir
John
argued
that
engineers
should
recognise
the
role
of
the
arts
in
their
work
-
among
other
benefits
;
this
could
attract
more
people
into
the
profession
.
The
lecture
,
Full
Steam
Ahead
for
Growth
,
advocated
a
wider
adoption
--
Steam
,
or
science
,
technology
,
engineering
,
arts
and
maths
.
Engineers
should
embrace
the
arts
as
being
key
to
creativity
and
an
important
component
of
innovation
,
crucial
to
creating
new
products
and
boosting
future
competitiveness
,
he
argued
.
""
Engineering
and
technology
is
an
increasingly
diverse
and
creative
field
,
""
said
Sir
John
.
 
Some
university
engineering
departments
already
cooperated
with
art
schools
to
develop
understanding
,
he
told
the
reporter
.
In
particular
he
mentioned
Cranfield
University
's
Centre
for
Creative
Competitive
Design
and
Imperial
College
's
work
with
the
Royal
College
of
Art
.
The
two
sets
of
people
could
work
well
together
and
more
emphasis
on
the
creative
side
of
engineering
could
improve
the
success
of
products
,
he
said
.
 
""
Aesthetics
is
part
of
it
,
""
he
told
the
reporter
,
adding
that
Apple
's
iPod
was
not
the
first
digital
media
player
,
nor
the
only
one
that
worked
-
but
it
came
to
dominate
the
market
""
because
it
was
nice
to
have
""
.
 
Sir
John
said
he
was
not
suggesting
universities
started
requiring
A-level
art
from
engineering
applicants
-
the
key
subjects
for
admission
would
continue
to
be
maths
and
the
sciences
.
But
an
emphasis
on
creative
skills
would
help
""
broaden
the
pool
and
attract
more
people
in
""

"All
Eskimos
live
most
of
their
lives
close
to
sea
or
fresh
water
.
They
may
follow
game
inland
for
several
hundred
miles
,
but
they
always
return
to
the
shores
of
rivers
,
lakes
,
or
seas
.
Eskimo
land
has
a
bare
look
.
Large
rocks
,
pebbles
,
and
sand
cover
much
of
the
surface
.
Plants
called
lichen
grow
on
the
rocks
,
and
where
there
is
enough
soil
,
grass
,
flowers
,
and
even
small
bushes
manage
to
live
.
No
trees
can
grow
on
Eskimo
land
,
so
geographers
sometimes
call
it
the
Arctic
plains
.
There
are
some
animals
in
Eskimo
land
,
such
as
rabbits
,
which
eat
the
plants
.
Other
animals
,
like
the
white
fox
and
the
gray
wolf
,
eat
the
rabbits
.
The
Eskimo
is
a
meat-eater
,
too
,
and
may
even
eat
a
wolf
when
food
is
scarce
.
 
The
Eskimo
year
has
two
main
parts
:
a
long
,
cold
winter
and
a
short
,
cool
summer
.
Spring
and
fall
are
almost
too
short
to
be
noticed
.
Summer
is
the
best
time
,
as
food
is
usually
plentiful
.
But
it
is
also
the
time
when
Eskimos
are
very
busy
.
Winter
is
never
far
away
,
and
the
men
must
bring
home
extra
meat
for
the
women
to
prepare
and
store
,
for
seldom
can
enough
animals
be
killed
in
winter
to
feed
a
family
.
 
The
Far
North
is
sometimes
called
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun
.
This
is
true
in
the
middle
of
summer
,
for
between
April
21st
and
August
21st
the
sun
never
sets
in
Northern
Greenland
.
But
in
midwinter
the
Far
North
is
a
land
with
no
sunshine
at
all
.
Around
Oct.
21st
the
Eskimos
of
Northern
Greenland
see
the
sun
set
directly
south
of
them
,
and
they
do
n't
see
it
again
until
February
22nd
.
All
places
on
earth
get
about
the
same
amount
of
daylight
during
a
year
.
As
a
result
,
if
summer
is
lighter
,
winter
has
to
be
darker
.
 
Winter
nights
in
the
Far
North
are
seldom
pitch-black
.
As
in
the
rest
of
the
world
,
the
stars
and
moon
provide
a
little
light
.
The
northern
lights
also
help
the
Eskimo
to
see
.
And
with
the
ground
covered
with
snow
,
even
a
little
light
is
reflected
back
to
the
Eskimo
's
eyes

"My
dad
is
a
wonderful
man
.
He
worked
hard
all
his
life
and
has
never
let
me
down.if
one
person
influenced
me
to
go
to
college
and
become
a
better
person
,
it
's
him
.
 
Every
morning
my
dad
would
wake
up
at
4
am
.
He
would
do
some
writing
and
then
Ieave
for
work
.
He
would
get
off
work
at
5
pm
and
spend
the
remaining
day
with
his
family
.
Any
time
I
needed
him
,
he
was
there
.
He
was
a
great
role
model
.
My
dad
is
a
typical
family
man
.
He
supports
us
financially
and
emotionally
.
He
bends
over
backward
to
support
his
family
.
 
My
dad
is
the
reason
why
I
try
to
support
my
son
as
much
as
I
can
.
He
is
 
also
the
reason
why
I
have
decided
to
spend
less
time
with
friends
and
more
time
 
with
family
.
Now
I
'm
a
much
better
woman
.
I
once
worked
hard
at
my
studies
in
 
school
and
now
do
well
in
my
work
.
My
dad
became
a
manager
in
less
than
three
 
years
and
I
hope
to
do
the
same
.
I
have
had
the
same
job
for
one
and
a
half
years
 
now
.
I
have
gotten
two
raises
and
become
a
shift
leader
.
-
 
I
remember
1
worked
extremely
hard
in
schoo1.I
never
missed
a
day
and
I
never
went
to
school
late
.
I
graduated
two
years
ago
.
It
is
something
for
me
to
be
proud
of
,
and
it
is
the
first
step
towards
becoming
a
psychologist
.
My
father
is
more
than
2,000
miles
away
,
but
I
never
forget
what
he
did
for
us
.
Every
day
my
work
gets
really
hard
,
I
think
of
my
dad
.
Every
time
I
feel
like
giving
up
,
I
think
of
him
